Following the departure of Ross and Kevin, myself and the Board will be looking to try a find a suitable replacement(s) to take up the vacant managerial positions.

Despite several telephone calls to me this morning from prospective managerial worthyâ€™s we have made the decision not to advertise but be proactive in identifying suitable candidates that we feel will meet our requirements and invite them for interview. Three have so far been identified and accepted and it is my intention to speak with them over the weekend.

It is my intention to keep supporters fully informed, whilst respecting confidences.
