As I write I’m taking a deserved breather after what was a really full weekend up in Brora. As well as the game against Cove Rangers, we had our annual golf day, Player of the Year awards and the further inductions into the Brora Rangers Hall of Fame.

Starting with the Friday, our annual Golf Day took place in less than ideal conditionsat Brora's Championship links course. I would like to say a sincere thank you to all the teams which entered the golf day. We had 15 four man teams competing for the prizes on offer and we are grateful to each and every one of them for their support. Likewise a debt of gratitude is due to Brora Golf Club whose course was as always presented in immaculate condition. The weather however was brutal, but it kept dry, and Sharon’s “Pims and Cake” tent was a great refuge to the haar and the cold - Well done Sharon.

The club are also very appreciative of the sponsors who supplied such generous gifts for the raffle and auction. Also, as Chairman, I would thank David Dowling for him organising the day and also to Sharon for all her hard work in support.

Also, of course, congratulations to our prize winners on the day, Scott Adamiec Electrical, City Financial and William Macbeath Joinery for the team prizes, and Jan Adamiec, Bernard Ledwith and Richard Smith for their individual awards.

Saturday brought the usual preparations for a home game, in this case the visit of newly confirmed Highland League Champions, Cove Rangers. A narrow victory for the visitors keeps them chasing some of the records we set in our 2 League topping seasons.

And so on to more awards and accolades.  

Congratulations to John Pickles and Colin Williamson who between them lifted the A team player awards, and a warm welcome to the Brora Rangers Hall of Fame to Stevie Cowie and Donald Allan.

Club favourites Ronnie and Donnie played until the early hours following the awards ceremony, and those there had a fantastic evening.

On the Sunday I watched the very entertaining under 17 game between Brora Rangers and Nairn County, with Brora running out 6-2 winners. It was encouraging to see parents and siblings out supporting the side and we certainly have several very promising young players within our squad.

For those of you that are not fully acquainted with the Brora Rangers Youth Initiative please visit their [recently launched website](https://bryi.org/) which tells you all about their activities and the range of teams including a wonderful vibrant ladies team run by Mary Stewart. To see our youth and ladies teams all kitted out in their Brora Rangers track suits made one very proud of the whole set up that is taking shape at Dudgeon Park.

As Head of Youth Development, Dale Pryde-MacDonald has developed and driven our strategy as well as keeping the club on the rails with his many compliance duties. He and the fantastic people who support him have my grateful thanks.

As our A team regroup and ready themselves for the challenges ahead, it is very reassuring that we are developing talent and future supporters by the work in the community and schools that our Youth Initiative is delivering.

We have a very bright future,a very bright future indeed.
