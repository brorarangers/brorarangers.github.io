If a handicapper got within 3 lengths of a group horse, connections would be elated. Likewise our 3-0 defeat away at Raith Rovers a month ago is now looking like a serious piece of form.

Raith Rovers are running away with Division 1 and looked nailed on to be Champions. I was speaking to one of their Directors this week and he felt Brora Rangers were the best side that they have played so far this campaign.

I only mention that game because I watched this evening the team go down 2-0 to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, playing every bit as well as they did at Kirkcaldy, in a friendly requested by Inverness ahead of their game against Dumbarton. The way we played confirmed to me that we are still bang in there for the league title despite our stuttering start to the season.

Ross is still trying to find his preferred  starting 11, and I'm sure he will smile when I remind him we've started with a different 11 in every competitive game so far. However with Malin, Duff, Williamson, Houston, Sutherland and Graham all absent this evening it brought home to me just how deep our squad is, and the fact they have all been getting game time this season will, I suspect, reap us rewards as the season progresses.

Our defeats at Huntly and at home to Inverurie dented our confidence somewhat, but the boys have come roaring back and the 3-0 win against current champions Buckie laid down a marker that we are still contenders for their crown.

I guess our weakness this year has been putting the ball in the net. We amazingly do not have a single player in the top 16 scorers in the Highland League this year, and with Messers Macleod, Campbell, Gunn, Graham, Sutherland, Greig, Brindle and others in our squad I wouldn't have believed our dearth of goals so far. When our luck in front of goal changes (and it will) that cohort of established marksmen will quickly make up for lost time!

This weeks our thoughts turn to the Scottish Cup and we welcome Girvan to Dudgeon Park. This is a must win game, as progression in the competition is vital for the club and I do hope we see as many of our supporters at the match as possible to cheer us on.
