Despite almost continual rain and a dull very cold day, the Club would like to say a big thank you and well done to all the travelling support who made the long journey to Fraserburgh yesterday.

The on field fayre was pretty poor with little football played, but the support stayed right behind the team and the players were most grateful.

An atrocious penalty decision against us ended our involvement in the match, but I'm sure Ross, The Doc and Duffers will have them right back up for the Buckie game next week.
