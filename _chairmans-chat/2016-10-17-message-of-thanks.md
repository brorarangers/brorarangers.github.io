This week, a message of thanks for the hardy Brora Rangers travelling support ...

In atrocious weather conditions, our wonderful band of travelling supporters sang and cheered the team to a great victory at Formartine United on Saturday.
 
It was a an especially good turnout given the continual driving rain and the support of the fans drove the players on and carried the team back into the game after Formartine had pulled a goal back. Their support literally won us the game and on behalf of the players and officials a heartfelt THANK YOU.
 
Great scenes and atmosphere also in the Grant Arms, where the travelling Ross County fans were totally outnumbered and out sang by our returning glorious troopers.
