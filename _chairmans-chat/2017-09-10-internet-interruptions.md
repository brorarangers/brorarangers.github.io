As somebody who has a very limited knowledge about technology, I'm not sure I fully understand why we lost our website, but it's absence brought home to me just how sorely missed it was, and just how vital an organ of communication it had become.

Our website by choice is simple in presentation, but more complex in construction which is fine until something goes array. Rather like an horologist with a old beloved clock, Ranald has worked tirelessly on "his baby" addressing both hardware and software issues and it's great to get our club mouthpiece back into the mainstream ether.

There will be a little time in uploading the content which never stopped being produced but we should be back to full steam ahead very soon.

This has been a big few days for our club. The very impressive North of Scotland Cup win at Nairn, the highly successful Gala Dinner at the Kingsmills Hotel and then the defeat of current league champions Buckie Thistle on Saturday. The website return adds to the current run of good news.

Indeed ... We are back!
