When the Board asked me to take the Chair, I was honoured to do so, filled with trepidation but also a positive enthusiasm for the role. I do hope to be able to make a difference and build on the work done by John Young.

Early doors it would also be remiss of me not to acknowledge the huge amount of work done by a host of people in simply just putting a match on, in the run up to the game and on match day itself. A big thank you to everybody involved.

We have added to our Board, with both Kevin Mackay and Denis Bridgeford joining our ranks, and I believe we are now set up to take our Club to the next level and build on the success of the past three seasons.

Change is good for us all, it’s change that keeps us alive and Brora Rangers must evolve to meet the challenges both on and off the field and with that change will come further development and progression.

I was certainly surprised at the cost of running a Highland League Football Club, something that everyone should be aware of. Whilst we will present the figures at our AGM (to be held during October), it will surprise many that there is very little change out of £300,000 and we are deeply indebted to our sponsors and everybody who contributes to club activities, not least the supporters. 

A special thanks and acknowledgement to our new Principle Club Sponsor, Rae Energy, whom we look forward to working with.

We hold our Annual Celebration Ball at the Kingsmills Hotel Inverness on Friday evening and David Dowling, Ali Mackenzie and Kevin Mackay have been beavering hard to surpass the high standards and results of last year. If you have not committed yet, please do, as this is a crucial day for the Football Club. A free coach has been laid on from Brora.

The Football Club is a business, albeit it with more eclectic aims and objectives than a normal commercial enterprise. However difficult decisions need to be taken with a view of achieving a balanced budget. We would not wish to compete with some of the more high spending clubs in the league, but nevertheless we believe we can achieve success without compromising on quality. The current difficulties faced by Nairn County are a salutary lesson to all, and we certainly would wish them well in the post MacIntosh era.

I’m delighted to welcome on board Andrews Coaches who are now our accredited transport partner. They have provided a new 53 seater Neoplan coach which has been proudly wrapped, front, back and side with the Cattach badge and logo. The coach will be customised inside to include 4 tables to compliment the bathroom and galley.

Bedecked in our Red and White colours, the bus certainly makes a statement and is a real head turner. The coach has already been to London on other duties and attracted a great deal of attention in the Capital as well at Invergordon when on cruise liner duties.

Our new kits have finally arrived from Adidas (it’s certainly worth waiting for quality) and very smart they look too. Replica shirts and other merchandise are now available through the Supporters Club and shortly to be available through the club website.

For the season ahead we have also revamped our hospitality offering with a variety of cuisines to suit all tastes and budgets. Russell Jaffrey has been working very hard to make our offerings a day to remember and our full packages are detailed within the programme and again on the website.

My Board and Committees are merely guardians and as such, I would welcome any suggestions for the betterment of the Club. I cannot promise to implement them all, but I can commit to replying to everybody. Please email me at [chairbrorarangers@btopenworld.com.](mailto: chairbrorarangers@btopenworld.com)
