Well, the curtain for our season will fall shortly and our last match of the long campaign will see us take on Fort William in the final of the North of Scotland Cup.

With the competition being played at the end of the league season, the closed season has been foreshortened and I know this has not been a popular decision with many of our supporters or players. Whilst the club are always delighted to partake in this Cup, we would have to consider very carefully our future involvement should it not be integrated back into the normal season's programme.

The final is to be held at Rothes on Saturday 20th May and we hope to see as many of our supporters there as possible.

The late timetabling of this competition had not been thought through as it was not until after our semi final win against Forres Mechanics was the venue for the final  decided. It is ironic that those clubs who voted for the late playing of the competition, then declined to make their grounds available for the final!

We have to thank Rothes for their kind gesture in offering their ground for the final. Not the most convenient location but literally the only show in town.

As we approach the drawing of stumps on the season, we can look back on a campaign of mixed fortunes, but we finish it with great hope and expectations for next year. There will no doubt be some new arrivals, but Ross has built up the nucleus of a very strong squad and he will be looking to build on this as we go forward. To have lost the league by a point is indicative of how close the title race was. We will all have differing views where we lost the title, but the home draw against Nairn County is a match which I felt was a particularly poor performance and a crucial 2 points dropped.

The new season will start on Saturday 29th July 2017, and the league fixture list will be published at the end of this month. The first round of the Challange Cup is on Wednesday 16th August with all future games on a Saturday. The format this year is very interesting with Premership teams fielding colts sides who are allowed some over age players, so any games against them will be far from easy. Also two teams from the Republic of Ireland have been invited to enter. It would be wonderful to progress in this!

I would like to say a big thank you to all the supporters that have remained loyal to the club throughout the season and I know how valued and appreciated your support is by Ross, his management team and all the players. Also to our main sponsor Rae Energy and our other commercial sponsors who play such a vital part in our success.

A big thank you also to Sandy our groundsman who for more years than he cares to remember has produced a wonderful pitch, regarded by many as one of the best playing surfaces in the league.

Finally, but not least I would extend my thanks to my fellow Board and Committee members who have put in countless hours of voluntary work and have been of great support to me in my first year as Chairman of the club.



William A Powrie
