Thanks to those that contacted me regarding my programme re-
marks last week ( v Fraserburgh).

As I said, I was expressing a personal opinion on the relation between our national game and summer football, but it certainly seems to have struck a chord
with many. The power too of social networks which carried the article far and wide and it was flattering to receive replies from
two SPFL clubs broadly supporting my position.

For those of you that use social networks I do hope that you are
approving of our new website. This is Version 2 of the project
which I sponsored at the beginning of last season and it would
be remiss of me not to place on record my deep gratitude to
Ranald Mackay for the hundreds of hours of work which he has
put into this. 

Today’s Club Notices outline the extend of the project and please do take the opportunity to visit the site and let me know what you think.

Having been away in France, I missed the Fraserburgh and Buckie games, but can I say a heartfelt thank you to those supporters who made the long journey down the Moray Coast for a mid-week fixture.

Given the result, but also the manner of our capitulation, it must have been a long journey back up the road with plenty of time to reflect on what was an unexpected outcome.

I've had some fantastic feedback from our last guests who took hospitality at the Fraserburgh match. It’s always reassuring to know that we are positioning our catering offering well, and with over 40 people sitting down last week Russell Jaffrey is certainly being kept busy.
