This week will see the preparations really swinging into to top gear ahead of what is probably the clubs biggest profiled match in its history.

Whilst the SPFL play-off game away to Montrose three years ago could  arguably be regarded as more important, it certainly did not attract the level of media publicity that our fifth round tie at Kilmarnock has generated.

These five days prior to Saturday, will fly by, and already a cohort of press engagements are pending.

Those of you who take the Sunday Herald, would have seen a fantastic article on Brora Ranges, and in particular John Pickles. For those that missed it, the [article is on their website](http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/15918613.Brora___s_roving_Ranger_John_Pickles_always_at_sea/). It certainly is well worth reading.

On Monday the BBC are filming at training, and will be conducting player interviews, and on Tuesday they travel up to Brora to meet our local player James Ross who will show them round the ground and village where hopefully further interviews will be done. I believe several shops in Brora have already decorated their windows and on behalf of everybody at the Club I would thank them for their very visible support.

The BBC intend to produce a feature on the team and this will be screened Saturday lunchtime during their iconic football focus program.

On Tuesday also, I am being interviewed by a Norwegian broadcaster, so it seems our achievement in reaching the fifth round has carried across the North Sea to our Viking cousins.

Thursday will see our Manager Ross Tokley interviewed on Talk Sport Radio on their Scottish football program hosted by Ali McCoist and this will again go out to a UK wide audience.

No doubt there will be numerous other articles in the daily newspapers, as all eyes turn towards the Saturday ties. As a club we have engendered so much goodwill, I expect to see a good contingent of neutral supporters at Kilmarnock to cheer the boys on.

We will of course not be short of our own travelling red army, who carried us to victory at Stranraer and East Fife. The travel arrangements with regard to coaches hope to be finalised early in the week, so please check with the normal Facebook/Twitter media feeds for full details. We will try to get as much posted on the website as possible but the social media channels are updated far quicker.

Our hosts at Kilmarnock, will accommodate our support behind the goal, which is ideal, as occasionally visiting supporters can be housed in an enclosure at the side. Itâ€™s always difficult to anticipate visiting support especially given the distance, but dare I hope for 500 to cheer us on?

A focused but exciting week ahead for Ross, Kevin and all the boys, and you will receive daily updates as we get ready to rumble in Killie.
