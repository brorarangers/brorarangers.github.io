It’s been a very busy week at the Club with the Annual Brora Rangers Celebration Ball taking place last Saturday.

Almost 180 people enjoyed what was an absolutely superb evening in the Kingsmills Hotel, Inverness. I would place on record my thanks to David Dowling, Ali Mackenzie and Kevin Mackay for the planning and organisation and the long hours of work put into the event.

Once again the generosity of our sponsors and benefactors ensured we had some superb prizes for our auction and raffle, and I would thank them sincerely for their wonderful gesture.

The final totals raised have not yet been totalled up, but the full information together with photographs of the night will appear on our website shortly.

As always the Scottish Cup engenders excitement, and this season we found ourselves back in the first round draw. The balls came out pairing us away with fellow Highland League team Fort William. We can remember well our exploits two years ago when in the 4th Round we travelled to Dumfries to play Queen of the South. That tie proved financially lucrative, and whilst we cannot take anything for granted, we would certainly hope that we can have a run in the competition this year.

It was very interesting listening to Neil Doncaster’s comprehensive radio interviews on the back of the recent SPFL and SFA meetings. I believe he was signalling some fundamental changes coming down the track to our national structure. Whilst this change will not happen overnight, I do expect there to be changes to league structures and cup competitions and I believe these can only benefit the national game and may permeate down to our own Highland League.

More cross border competitions seem likely and there has been much speculation around the inclusion of premier league Colts teams in lesser leagues. At this stage nothing has been proposed but we at Brora will keep an open mind until and if any changes are put forward.

I’ve been delighted by the number of supporters who have contacted me with their ideas and suggestions. Some of the more ambitious plans will need time to consider, but a few suggestions I will take forward with me to the next Board Meeting.
