Brora Rangers travel to Grant Street Inverness on Saturday to defend the North of Scotland FA Cup,where they will face Lossiemouth in the final.

We have won this competition in 3 of the last 4 seasons and are definitely not ready to relinquish the trophy quite yet. Whilst success has become relatively recent for ourselves, Lossiemouth are no strangers to taking the trophy home.

The Cup has been a regular fixture at Dudgeon Park since 2013-14, but we can't take all the credit since then ... unless we claim that the usual fantastic work of Groundsman Sandy helped Wick Academy win their first senior trophy back in 2015-16 on our home turf.

Whilst we beat Lossie to picking up the trophy by placing it in our cabinet in 1980-81, Lossie have a particularly successful North of Scotland Football Association campaign from 1994 until 1997. Lossie have raised this trophy above their heads as recently as 2002-03 and must be readying themselves for this game with a fair degree of confidence given their last few games and results.

Speaking to the Northern Times at the start of the week, Manager Ross Tokely commented, *"The past two results have been the reaction I have asked of the players after the defeat to Formartine and now we look forward to the cup final this Saturday. I thought we played some cracking football in the first half on Saturday against the wind and we should of been 3 or 4 goals up at the break. It seems the story of the season, not taking our chances, but the fact we are creating opportunities in games is pleasing so we need to keep working hard in training and having the belief to be ruthless in front of goal. It has been great to see local lad James Ross to take his chance in the last two games and he has impressed the coaching staff with his attitude and desire to stay in the team."*

*"I would like to thank the fans for there support and hope they turn out in their numbers this Saturday. I remember the first NoS cup final against Nairn where the size and noise of the Brora Rangers support that day gave us such a lift and I hope we get the same this weekend.  We have this cup final to look forward to, a winnable Scottish cup game down at Stranraer and whilst we have 7 points to rein in to catch Cove Rangers in the league, we still have to play them twice, and if we replicate our second half of last seasons performances,where we only missed the league title by a solitary point,then we believe we are are still in the title race".*

When we first announced the appointment of Ross as our Manager back on Christmas Eve last year we were more than happy to quote Tokes ...

*"I will give everything I have to succeed and win more trophies for this club. The players, myself and the club will continue to compete for The trophies on offer ... I promise you that."*

That is all we ask.

As the weekend approaches, it would only be fair to repeat Ross' words ...

*"I would like to thank the fans for their support and hope they turn out in their numbers this Saturday. I remember the first NoS cup final against Nairn where the size and noise of the Brora Rangers support that day gave us such a lift and I hope we get the same this weekend."*

Big Rab knows what it is like to be part of a North of Scotland Cup winning team ... we hope memories are enough for him this weekend.
