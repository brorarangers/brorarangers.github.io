It was wonderful to be back in Stornoway at the weekend and great that so many of our players could make it over. Indeed, Ross took 19 players across the Minch and everybody had at least 45 minutes football.

The weekend was about so much more than the match, and there was some pretty hard partying going on until the wee small hours of Sunday morning. This was as much a team bonding exercise as anything, to knit the players into a unit together for the season ahead. 

I would like to thank Coby Macleod of the Western Isles FA for arranging the match and the wonderful meal and hospitality which they laid on for all our players, officials and supporters in the County Hotel after the game. As far as post match hospitality goes, the season has already reached its high point!

A big thank you also to the travelling supporters who were very much part our our "team". They all enjoyed themselves and the players appreciate their support.
