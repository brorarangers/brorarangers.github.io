As we prepare to move from British Summer Time to thoughts of a North of Scotland winter, November could turn out to be a very important month for Brora Rangers.

It's not that we have any big Cup games, Clyde put paid to that last weekend for a while. It's not that our [Cattachs Lotto](/lotto/) has been through a major makeover and we expect to make someone a millionaire in time for Christmas, though it is worth checking out our [Lotto page](/lotto/) and setting up your Standing Order. It's not that we have any table top clashes, we have to wait until December for that. In fact our next 3 games are against teams currently sitting at the foot of the Scottish Highland Football League.

And that is exactly why it could prove to be very important.

The current top four Clubs in the League have all played 14 games before kick off this afternoon. Only 7 points separate us all, with 60 points still on offer for everyone. Every point is a prisoner again this season. There were only 4 points separating 1st and 3rd place last season. Formartine Utd snatched second place from us only on a Goal Difference borne from a record breaking scoring season.

League leader's Buckie Thistle will be preparing to kick off down at Gretna's Raydale Park as you picked up your Programme, looking for a win in their 2nd Round Scottish Cup replay. Formartine Utd will be getting ready to face Banks o' Dee at North Lodge Park in their replay. Whilst we wish them both every success in their Cup endeavours, Cove Rangers and ourselves will be aiming to capitalise on their absence.

Next weekend, the 5th November ... remember, remember ... Cove Rangers and Buckie Thistle meet in the Final of the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup. Formartine Utd host Fraserburgh, never an easy game. Meanwhile, we'll hope to carry on getting League games played and 3 points collected.

The 12th of November sees Buckie Thistle travel to Formartine's NLP, and they can't both pick up 3 points that weekend. The following weekend we are all back in League action again, but if all goes to plan, there will have been some movement at the top of the table.

The 26th of November is the date set for the 3rd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup. Cup runs are important to Highland League Clubs, they generate much needed income, they generate much welcomed interest and publicity. We hope both Formartine Utd, Buckie Thistle and Forres Mechanics get the required results today to ensure they can represent the Highland League along with Wick Academy. In the meantime, Cove will be planning to make hay, as it were.

It's a cliche, but there are few easy games in this League, no result is a foregone conclusion, but there are definitely some fixtures that are guaranteed to be tougher than others. Who leaves their home turf to face Buckie, Cove or Formartine thinking they are going to pick up an easy 3 points? We took 3 points from our away fixtures at Victoria Park, Harlaw Park and North Lodge Park. Could have been better, could have been worse, but they're done for this season. Our League challengers have yet to make some of these away trips to each other, someone has to drop points, others will no doubt benefit. Who turns up to Dudgeon Park expecting an easy stroll to a win? All three Clubs have yet to visit us this season.

This isn't a four team League either. Competition is fierce, and there are many teams capable of upsetting the apple cart. We've chalked off our Turriff and Wick trips and picked up the 6 points. There will be other trips where it will be equally tough to take the points home. There will be home games where we will need to be at our best to finish victorious at full time, but November could prove to be a very important month for us.

Who would have thought the approaching wintery weather would be an opportunity to make hay while the sun shines.
