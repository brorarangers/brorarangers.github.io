Well they say a week is a long time in politics, and certainly the last 10 days has been a long one in the running of Brora Rangers.

At this stage it’s important to acknowledge the great support and understanding from our players and fans at this most difficult of times. We saw last week at Rothes the responses of both team and supporters and much credit to Steven MacDonald, Ally Macleod and Allan Duff for their consummate professionalism
in what has been a period of change.

It’s a great pity that things didn’t quite work out for Grant Munro, and I will reiterate that the 2-1 home defeat to Cove Rangers was not the contributory factor in Grant leaving the Club. In fact, the club sit top of the league and are still bang in the mix for the Championship, and have the Highland League and North of Scotland Cups to compete in, so Grant’s tenure at the helm could certainly be viewed as successful.

However, as with any job in any walk of life, if you’re not enjoying it and things are not going as you wish, then the hard but difficult decision is to move on, and everybody at the club wishes him well for the future. As I’ve mentioned before, change is what keeps all of us alive and the Club is no different, so the application process has been completed and an interview shortlist has now been drawn up.

Football is a great game, the 90 minutes on a Saturday afternoon is what we all love, but the love affair goes deeper than that. It’s the build up to the match, the anticipation of the team selection and of course the post match analysis and opinions which give us all the oxygen to get through to the next Saturday.

No sooner than the game kicks off, the opinions start, who is playing and
shouldn’t be, and who is not and should be? - Throughout the game it’s all about tactics, who is pulling their weight and who isn’t, and of course after the 90 minutes in the cauldron, a brief respite until it all starts again with the build up to the next game.

Then of course comes the social media “stuff” which keeps the pot boiling, with a variety of opinions ranging from the well thought out and reasoned to the plain ridiculous, mischievous and simply wrong.

As always, our communication policy is to publish all Club news on here first, and as soon as there is anything to report it will be posted here with signposts via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/). Next in the pipeline is a Brora Rangers Newsletter for those who want a regular email to keep them up to date with all the latest news.

At this stage it would be remiss not to mention and thank Ranald Mackay who is responsible for all our online work and promotion and is on permanent standby. Our website last week was viewed over 3800 times so this is testament to Ranald’s skills.

It was an absolute pleasure to be at Rothes last week. Yes, we won very comfortably and it was a timely 3 points in difficult circumstances, however it was also great to see the progress Ian and his Board are making at the club. The hospitality at the ground was bursting at the seams, there was a decent crowd at the game, and afterwards in the social club there was wonderful food raffles, and well over 100 people adding to the clubs coffers. Rothes are a club really going in the right direction - a great recovery from the difficulties they were in a couple of years ago, so well done to them and their sponsors. The Highland League is all the stronger for a vibrant Rothes.

Entertainment and value for money is important, and the Highland League certainly provides that. We broke records with our 57 game unbeaten run on our way to our second League title ... whilst that may be bettered, it won't be for a few seasons. Just as important as the display on the pitch is the camaraderie we enjoy as part of the Scottish Highland Football League. On Saturday we had a self confessed 'Groundhopper' visiting from Renfrewshire. Joe definitely enjoyed his visit, expressing his admiration for not only the way the team performed on the pitch, but also for the impression he left with of a 'well run Club'. The ladies in the Pie Shop were singled out for particular praise.

Come back soon Joe.
