I’m afraid I cannot be at the Fraserburgh match today as I’m away in Dijon, but rest assured come match time I shall be glued to my data feed hoping that good news will be coming through the ether.

Last night I was privileged to be invited to an under 18 game, played on a full sized synthetic pitch, the climax to the local summer season out here. For a “non senior match” the standard of skill and ball control was amazing and I’m sure most if not all of the players on show will go on to much higher honours within the game.

Compare this to the lashing we got at Fort William last week, and the Herculean efforts from the ground staff even to get the game on.

When you look at how our senior representatives perform in European competition in recent years, results have become almost staggering.

For Scottish teams to be beaten by teams from Gibraltar, Malta, Slovenia and in recent years Iceland, Finland and Wales would have been unthinkable only a few years back.

Yet no lessons appear to have been learned and I will guarantee that Scottish teams will all but be out of European competition by August 2017 next season.

However over the Irish Sea, where the football authorities have repositioned their season, Dundalk have qualified for the lucrative Europa League and only a last minute goal from Legia Warzsaw denied them potentially qualifying for the Champions League itself.

When European competition begins the Irish are half way through their season and have therefore no issues/excuses with player readiness of pre-season.

Imagine the Highland League adopted a similar strategy of perchance playing February to November. I suspect the Highlanders would fare better against their “senior” rivals in competitions such as the League Cup, Challenge Cup and the early rounds of the Scottish Cup. This would surely bring some welcome recognition and “voice” in the Scottish game.

Additionally, how much easier would it be to run player development programmes in the bright summer evenings as opposed to the harshness of a Scottish winter. Youth development in our country, with a handful of a few worthy exceptions, is lamentable, and no wonder so many youngsters prefer to play the game on a video screen than on a pitch.

I would love to see an indoor full size pitch in each of the cities/towns who host a team in the top two Scottish leagues, or alternatively in the most populated 15 or 20 population centres and these to be managed by a series of professionaly recognised and remunerated full time coaches.

The game is all upside down, and the authorities appear to be more concerned with the game and therefore their status from the “top down” instead of building it from the “bottom up,”

Until we gradually turn this pyramid around, we will be facing the same issues with amazing regularity with a diminishing European coefficient and teams out of Europe before pre-season is complete.

I must add that these views are my own and not that of Brora Rangers Football Club. However having seen what I have in Dijon and Lyon I think that there must be room created for a debate within all of Scottish Football, to bring back players, skill levels, legacy and supporters to our national game.
