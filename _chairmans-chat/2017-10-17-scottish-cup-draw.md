In yet another shambles of an SFA draw, Brora Rangers were handed the cruelest of outcomes, when eventually after a re-draw were paired away to Stranraer in the 3rd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup.

During a draw held in Montrose and conducted by Derek Sim and Archie Knox, Brora originally ball 9 in the hat, were drawn at home to Queens Park. However as the draw progressed ball 9 was drawn again and this time away to fellow Highland League side Buckie Thistle. Recognising their mistake SFA officials immediately pulled the plug on the live Facebook coverage, and hastily announced a total re-draw would be made.

On considered reflection I am most concerned with the chain of events which will lumber the club with substantial travel and accommodation bills in the fulfilment of the long distance fixture.

I blame not Messers Sim and Knox. The competition is the crown jewel in the SFA's responsibilities, and they have not for the first time been remiss in their stewardship of such. The SFA must immediately look at the organisation and hosting of future cup draws as the process of the draw travelling around and being undertaken by local worthies does not work. It shows the SFA in very poor light indeed.

We were delighted to be in the hat for the 3rd round draw and we still travel to Stranraer with confidence. However having originally been paired at home to Queens Park only for that to be taken away, we have been left with an expensive sour taste in our mouth.

The Board immediately wrote to the Chief Executive of the SFA, not seeking yet another re-draw, but perhaps a small contribution towards our costs, but predictably the request fell on stoney ground. I certainly look forward to visiting Stranraer and we have little to fear, but the whole experience of "This is what you could of had lads" is not good!

Genuine mistakes can happen but the Cup draw is far too important to be left to amateurs and should be undertaken by SFA officials, at HQ preferably midweek following the Saturday ties. This would allow plenty of time to ensure all procedures are correct and that due diligence undertaken to prevent the type of shambles we have seen this season.

The screening of the draw live on Facebook, also needs looking at, as simply pulling the plug when an issue arises does nothing to enhance the experience at all".
