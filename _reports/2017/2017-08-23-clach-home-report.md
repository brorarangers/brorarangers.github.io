Two goals from Paul Brindle saw Brora progress to the 2nd Round of the North of Scotland Cup at the expense of his old club.

In a welcome break from the stuttering start to our league campaign, a solid performance from the squad was a pleasing start to our defence of this trophy.

It's off to Nairn County's Station Park on the 6th September for the next round ... with the form Nairn have been showing this season, that's going to be an exciting tie!
