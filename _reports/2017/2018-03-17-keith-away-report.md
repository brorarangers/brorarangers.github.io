Brora Rangers  progressed into the semi finals of the Breedon Highland League Cup after a comfortable but workmanlike victory over Keith at Kynoch Park on Saturday.

On a bitterly cold afternoon, the bitingly gusty wind and saturated pitch was always going to make playing difficult, and so it proved. However it was Brora who emerged victorious after a late winner from Martin Maclean saw them through to the semi finals where they will face Formartine United.

Brora had previously beaten Keith 3-0 the previous Saturday on league business but it was a very different Keith side which took to the park for the cup tie, and deservedly went in at half-time all square, with a Cammy Keith equaliser cancelling out a Steven Mackay strike which put Brora ahead in the 25th minute.

Keith were forced to field their 17-year-old goalkeeper Regan Stuart in place of David Dey and the youngster made several excellent stops early on in the game. However he was unable to do much about Steven Mackay’s opener , who struck his 12 yard shot through a wall of defenders, and past the unsighted Stuart.

Some slack defending in the Brora ranks saw Cammy Keith equalise immediately from the restart, when he picked up on a long clearance, rounded John Pickles and fired high into the net past Joe Malin.

The second half started brightly for Brora, although Keith did squander a chance when Michael Selfridge failed to convert a relatively straightforward header at the far post. At the other end of the park, Steven Mackay saw his header strike the outside of the post, and also his 30 yard drive which went narrowly wide.

Martin Maclean went very close for Brora, but his shot rebound from the crossbar, but with nine minutes remaining, he latched onto a loose ball in the penalty area to whip it past the stranded Stuart, to give Brora the victory their second half dominance deserved.

Brora manager Ross Tokely said “it was our aim to get into the semi-final, and in that respect it was a successful afternoon. The weather conditions made football almost impossible, and I must credit all my players for sticking to the task. Keith played very well, and in particular their young reserve goalkeeper who made several great saves.

The Keith manager Dean Donaldson said, “ it was a night and day performance compared to the previous week”.

“I thought we were the better team in the first half and created a few half chances. However both sides did well in the very difficult playing conditions”.
