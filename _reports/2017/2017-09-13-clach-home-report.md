Brora Rangers grabbed all 3 points with second half goals from Ally Macdonald and Paul Brindle.

A well taken goal from Clach's Maclennan in the 40th minute delighted the travelling support, especially given the amount of possession Brora had commanded throughout the first half.

Ally Macdonald levelled the scores shortly after Tokely's no doubt robust half time team talk with a fantastic dipping volley.

Whilst the Inverness side appeared to be content to return south with a point, the sound of fraying nerves was almost audible from the home support as Brora attacked time after time and the clocked ticked down.

Paul Brindle took obvious delight in silencing many of his former fans with a composed shot in the 82nd minute.
