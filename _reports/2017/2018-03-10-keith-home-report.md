Brora score three goals and pick up three points in a rearranged League game at Dudgeon Park on a wet and bitterly cold Saturday afternoon.

Goals from Scott Graham, Steven Mackay and Zander Sutherland ensured Brora ran out the winners in this rearranged fixture, whilst Keith keeper saved a penalty before being forced to leave the field through injury.

Brora appeared to be fully in control for most of the match, which bodes well for our Breedon Highland League Cup tie at Kynoch Park next weekend.
