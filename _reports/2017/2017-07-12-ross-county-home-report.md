We welcomed a few old friends back to Dudgeon Park on Wednesday evening from the Ross County Development Squad, and then sent them back to Dingwall with a 3-0 defeat to reflect on.

The young Staggies started the match in impressive style, looking assured and composed on the ball and possibly looking the better team, but failed to create any real goal scoring opportunities.

Whilst Brora were perhaps playing less pretty football, it took some fine efforts from Ross Munro in the County goal to prevent us from edging ahead early on.

As it was, neither side could break the deadlock as referee Darren Munro signalled half time.

Brora stepped up a gear in the second half and it wasn't long before Kyle Macleod steered a cross from Chubbs into the back of the net. The introduction of substitutes Gavin Morrison, Paul Brindle and Craig Cameron saw Brora really get the upper hand and Cammy scored a further two goals to finish the game.

Despite the final scoreline, the Dingwall youngsters look like they could well be challenging for futher honours again this coming season.

Our photo shows two very proud mascots for the game, Archie Macleod in his Ross County strip and Liam Mackenzie, who will no doubt need to explain his Brora Rangers top when he returns to training with Ross County.
