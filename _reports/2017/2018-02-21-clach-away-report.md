Once again Brora Rangers travelled home the losers in another 5 goal game as Clachnacuddin recorded their sixth home win of the league season, and we our fourth away defeat.

Fraser Robertson opened the scoring for The Lilywhites in the 14th minute, with Mark Nicolson scoring the equaliser 10 minutes before half time. A Michael Finnis penalty saw the home side take the ead again in the 61st minute, followed up by a James Beeston goal six minutes later.

Scott Graham scored against his old club in the  69th minute, but the equaliser proved to be elusive and the game ended in another 3 points dropped as we continue to play catch-up in the many games postponed through adverse weather and Cup ties over the next couple of months.

It's back to the Breedon Highland League Cup this Saturday as we entertain Turriff Utd in the first round.
