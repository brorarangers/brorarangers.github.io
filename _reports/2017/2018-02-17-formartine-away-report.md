Five goals, an early red card, and end to end football. Meetings between Formartine Utd and ourselves seldom disappoint when it comes to entertainment.

However, we definitely left disappointed at full time with 3 points dropped after a hard working performance from the squad.

The first half hour alone provided enough action to keep most Highland League fans happy; an early goal from Scott Barbour, a straight red card for Gavin Morrison, the equaliser from Martin Maclean minutes later and a solo effort from Steven Mackay to put us in the lead all within the first 25 minutes.

As 10 man Brora battled to keep the lead throughout the 2nd half tired legs and some clinical finishing from Rodger and Macphee in the final 10 minutes saw Formartine run out the winners.
