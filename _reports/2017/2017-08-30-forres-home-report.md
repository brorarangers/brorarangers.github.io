Rarely will supporters have seen such a game of two halves at Dudgeon Park, as Brora Rangers ran out 3-0 winners against Forres Mechanics on Wednesday night.

A first half of free flowing football and total dominance saw the Cattachs go in at half time 3-0 up, with the visitors unable to manage a single attempt at goal, with Brora keeper Hoban reduced to spectacular status.

The second half saw a much more determined Forres as they sought to take the game to Brora and whilst the home side squandered at least three further easy chances, Forres themselves rattled the woodwork three times, and were unlucky to end up without a goal to their name.

From the off, Brora were focused and determined and immediately went onto the attack with Sutherland looking especially industrious in the middle of the park. Indeed it was a ball from Sutherland into the path of Paul Brindle which allowed the striker to fire past Knight in the Forres goal.

Scott Graham and Martin Maclean were both finding plenty of space and both had chances to add to the scoresheet but poor finishing cost the Cattachs. However Brora doubled their advantage in 28  minutes when Nicolson drove home a great cross from Sutherland.

Brora added a third within 2 minutes when a Graham cross was met by MacDonald, who eventually found Duff for him to slot home in a crowded penalty area.

As nightfall  fell the Cattachs had the wind in their sails, and Graham really should have added number 4 but poor finishing, not for the first time, cost him dear, and Knight made a superb save from Martin Maclean to keep the score at just 3.

The second half saw Forres come out and give it a go, sensing they had little to lose, and caught the Cattachs by surprise with a period of 20 minutes of sustained pressure. Brora seemed to lose their shape as they were forced onto the back foot and were finding it difficult to get hold of the ball. However for all their possession Forres were restricted to several long range efforts which Hoban dealt comfortably with.

Forres could count themselves a little unlucky not to have scored as long range efforts from Pollock and McGovern hit the outside of the woodwork and Duncanson wasted a golden opportunity when he too saw his effort rebound off the crossbar from close range.

Brora weathered the visitors storm and gradually got back into the game, and at least 7 players had very good scoring chances, with Brindle, Campbell and Graham missing the easiest of them.

Brora Manager Ross Tokely will be left to reflect on a largely satisfactory performance, bar a horrible first 20 minutes of the second half, but will be rueing some very poor finishing from his players.
