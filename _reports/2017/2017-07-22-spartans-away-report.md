Brora Rangers signed off their preseason campaign with a well deserved draw against a well drilled and organised Spartans side, on a day more resemblant to January than July in Edinburgh.

In at times torrential rain and a day so dark that floodlights were needed in the second half, playing conditions were difficult and the synthetic pitch a bit skiddy.

Brora were the dominant side in the first half with Campbell,Macleod and Sutherland all looking sharp and dangerous up front, and Blair Carswell was kept busy in the Spartans goal.

Spartans were not without their first half chances and Joe Malin had to be sharp off his line to deny Ross Allum. Generally though Duff and Williamson were comfortably in control at the back.

The teams welcomed the break from the elements at half time, although Brora should really have been comfortably ahead.

Spartans changed their tactics in the second half, and it was Brora who were forced onto the back foot and it was no surprise when the home side took the lead after 54 minutes when Allum played a nice pass into Guthrie who beat Malin with a close range effort.

Brora slowly clawed their way back into the tie, and Brindle and Graham both had good efforts saved. However with time running down, it was left to Colin William who ghosted in at the far post to connect with a free kick to place the ball almost in slow motion past the stranded Carswell.

At stumps, it was a well deserved draw for Brora Rangers, and an excellent work out for the season ahead for both sides. Spartans entertain Hawick and Brora travel to Lossiemouth to kick off their league campaigns.

Ross Tokely has now had a excellent  preseason of 6 varied friendlies and will now be beginning to formulate in his mind his starting line up for next week.

Spartans were excellent hosts and looked after us really well. They have an excellent set up down in Pilton and their  moto "Here for Good" seems most appropriate.
