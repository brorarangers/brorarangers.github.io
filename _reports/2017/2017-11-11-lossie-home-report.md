Whilst there was no sign of Steve McQueen or James Coburn at Dudgeon Park on Saturday, we had a Magnificent 7 to enjoy nonetheless.

First half goals from Steven Mackay and Zander Sutherland were followed by another couple from them after the break and a Kyle Macleod hat-trick. Meanwhile Joe Malin celebrated his return to first team football with a clean sheet.
