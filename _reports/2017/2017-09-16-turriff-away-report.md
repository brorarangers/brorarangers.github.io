You know what they say, when it rains, it pours. Given the recent weather and the forecast for Friday night the biggest surprise is probably that ths was the only fixture to fall foul of the weather.

However, as Turriff no doubt were keen to make ammends for Wednesday night's result againts Cove, and we were keen to keep up the momentum of wins in the past few weeks, both clubs and their supporters were left to find alternative entertainment.

Meanwhile, Formartine and Deveronvale picked up 3 points. Cove and Buckie also gained 3 points in real style, keeping clean sheets in the process, and Fraserburgh continue to keep the pressure on in the top section of the table.

However, it is only mid September and we are barely a third of the way through the League fixtures. Whilst the players may have been frustrated; Jimmy, our man you need to pass for a seat in the Stand at Dudgeon Park, may have been forced to look out the paintbrush for some DIY; the Inverness Branch of our Supporters Club had to follow each other around the bars of the city without ever actually managing to meet up and the rest of us were reduced to an afternoon of Tam, Stuart and Sportscene ... there is plenty of time to catch up on postponed games so far.

Next weekend we all turn our attention to Scottish Cup duty, always a welcome break, especially for those not involved in the all Highland League ties.
