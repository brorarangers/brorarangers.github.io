True to form, the North Derby certainly didn't disappoint. In the past few seasons there has been little to seperate the two teams, and this weekend it came down to a single goal again.

An early goal from Martin Maclean was cancelled out on the half hour mark by Jack Halliday. Paul Brindle put us back in the lead just before the half time whistle to keep up the momentum over the break.

In the 51st minute a Richard Macadie penalty levelled the scores again, and so began a time of nervous tension for fans of both sides.

A further penalty awarded in the 75th minute, taken and scored by Scott Graham ensured it was the Sutherland squad and support who returned home jubilant.
