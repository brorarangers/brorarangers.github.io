A pitch inspection on Tuesday evening confirmed that Seafield Park in Grantown on Spey is frost bound, with no chance of a change before our rescheduled League fixture on Wednesday evening.

The weather has also forced the postponement of Forres' fixture against Wick Academy, leaving both ourselves and our more northerly neighbours with 15 League games to complete between this coming Saturday and the 14th April.

The Keith v Deveronvale and Rothes v Turriff Utd games have also had to concede early defeats to the weather, leaving Cove Rangers, Fort William and Huntly to hope Wednesday's weather allows their fixtures against Clachnacuddin, Nairn County and Inverurie Locos to go ahead.
