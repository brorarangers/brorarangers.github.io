Brora Rangers made the long journey back from Bellslea Park on Saturday with a hard fought but well deserved point after their 1-1 draw against Fraserburgh.

A looping Steven Mackay cross equalised a Gary Harris penalty strike for the home side ensuring the spoils were shared after a goalless first half.

For the neutral this was an enjoyable game of football, without too much football being played. It was certainly a contest where the ball spent a lot of time in the air, and both sets of defences were to the fore.

Tokely again shuffled the pack, starting with Campbell as his central striker, supported on the flanks by Sutherland and Greig. With Morrison again suspended, MacDonald, Nicolson and Maclean made up the middle quartet.

Brora started the brighter and forced two corners in the opening few minutes, with Nicolson and Williamson both going close with headers. The first real chance of the match fell to Brora, but Zander Sutherland was unable to beat Peter Tait who saved well.

Martin Maclean was having a good game, very busy in the middle of the park, and he connected well with Craig Campbell who was adding some strength to the Brora front line, holding the ball up and giving the visitors a presence through the centre of the park.

Fraserburgh's best chance of the first half fell to William West, but his tame shot was deflected onto the outside of the Brora goalpost.

The goalless first half was a fair indicator of the 45 minutes play, and the second period heralded very much of the same, with both defences very much in command. However it was the home side that took the lead, following some neat interplay on the right by Combe and Cowie, and the ball into West forced Maclean to catch the Broch striker from behind, and referee Scott Leslie had no hesitation in awarding the spot kick, which Gary Harris duly converted low to the left of Hoban in the Brora goal.

One down, Brora were forced to go onto the attack and the Fraserburgh keeper was forced to make good saves from Maclean and the head of Williamson. At the other end Hoban made a wonderful fingertip save from West and steered the ball away for a corner.

With the clock running down, Mackay who was switching from left to right, found himself wide on the right flank. His cross drifted into the box, deceiving Tait with the angle of flight and found its way into the Fraserburgh net. The equaliser was no more than the visitors deserved and whilst Scott Graham should have sealed all three points for Brora, his finishing when clear on goal was woeful and allowed Tait to smother his shot.

Cattachs Tokely was pleased with the application of his team but left to rue the final miss from Graham. "We had the best chances of the game, but it's a really tough place to visit, and they are always hard opponents to play against."
