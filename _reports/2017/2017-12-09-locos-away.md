Winter took its icy grip of the Highland League again this weekend. Postponments all round apart from Forres Mechanics v Rothes.

This was a game both sides would have relished, and was the perfect tester for our upcoming League Cup meeting.

However, snow and ice dictate that we now go into a huge game against Fraserburgh well rested.
