With every point a prisoner between now and the end of the season, Brora collected three vital ones, when they defeated Nan County 1-0, at Station Park, courtesy of a headed goal from Kyle McLeod.

Whilst there was only one goal in the game, Brora nevertheless controlled much of the play, and were unlucky on several occasions not to extend their lead. That said, Nairn were not without their chances, and Joe Malin had to be at his very best to prevent a 30 yard strike from Jordan Macrae in as early as at the ninth minute.

Brora took the lead in the 20th minute when a Steven Mackay header back across the goal found Kyle Macleod in space, and he rose to give the visitors the lead.

Brora should have added to their total when a Gavin Morrison freekick was punched away by the Nairn keeper, but Scott Graham seemed surprised to be the recipient of such good fortune and his shot sailed harmlessly over the crossbar.

Kyle Macleod thought he had added to his tally shortly after the restart, but his effort was adjudged offside. Macleod was in the heart of the action shortly thereafter but this time his header went narrowly wide.

In the 68 minute Kyle Macleod had another headed opportunity which came back off the bar, but no Brora player was on hand to convert the chance, and McKenzie played the ball off his own goal-line to bring some respite to the Nairn defence.

With the substitution of Scott Lyle and Scott Graham, Brora lost their attacking momentum, and gave Nairn the opportunity to come back at them in the last 20 minutes of the game, and Joe Malin had to be at his absolute best to block a goal bound drive by Smith.

It was a case of man the pumps for the Brora defence, and Steven Mackay was dismissed for dissent eight minutes from time, but the Brora back line held firm to take the valuable three points back up the A9.
