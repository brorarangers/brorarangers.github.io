It was a typically feisty North Derby on Wednesday evening with no shortage of incidents to keep spectators entertained.

Four penalties given, one penalty saved, four goals, a red card and a point apiece for the protaganists would neatly sum up this match in one sentence.

Sam Mackay opened the scoring for the visitors with a penalty after only 9 minutes. His second penalty attempt in the 23rd minute was saved by Joe Malin as he continues to keep the Brora points tally rising.

The score remained unchanged at half time, but so far Brora had failed to impress.

A change of Wick penalty taker saw Craig Gunn double the Scorries score within the first 10 minutes of the second half as referee David Watt point to the spot yet again.

And the penalties weren't finished yet, with Steven Mackay scoring from the spot for Brora in the 70th minute.

As the 90 minute mark approached it was Kyle Macleod who finally found the net in open play, levelling the score at 2-2. Cue the customary frantic last few minutes of time added on as both teams fought to snatch the winning goal ... which didn't come, and saw James Ross receive a red card.
