The north derby was certainly a feisty affair littered with crunching tackles, cards, a sending off and the award of 4 penalties, 3 of them to the visitors.

Brora Rangers came from 2 down to equalise and, at the death, their 10 men came within a whisker of snatching a most unlikely victory against their northern rivals Wick Academy.

With quite a long list of injuries and absentees, the Cattachs team sheet had a comparatively unfamiliar look. In front of Joe Malin, the defence lined up with James Ross, Colin Williamson, Mark Nicholson and Steven ‘Sid’ MacKay and a midfield featuring Scott Graham, Scott Lisle, Martin MacLean and James Pickles with Kyle MacLeod and Paul Brindle upfront.

The Scorries made the most of the early running and earned a penalty as early as the 7th minute when former Brora man Craig Gunn was brought down on a run into the box. Sam MacKay smashed the spot-kick home to put the visitors ahead. Worse was to follow for the home side when in the 12th minute Brora’s speedy striker Paul Brindle limped off with a hamstring problem and had to be substituted by Craig Campbell. Cammy almost had an immediate impact when his low left wing cross was almost converted by Kyle MacLeod who had got across the last defender but Wick keeper Sean McCarthy managed to hold on to MacLeod’s effort at the near post.

Wick’s Craig Gunn, Alan Hughes and Gordon McNab were posing a potent threat to the home defence. Brora seemed to lack the zest that was evident earlier in the season. After their great Scottish Cup run to the last 16 and the disappointment of their Highland League Cup semi-final defeat to Formartine, playing catch-up on their League fixtures must have felt a bit like after the Lord Mayor’s show. There was a distinct lack of width about their attacking play and they certainly missed the guile and skill of the injured Zander Sutherland wide on the right.

After the home side came close to getting back on terms when Sid MacKay’s low effort at the far post from a right wing cross was smothered away, in the 20th minute, they conceded a second penalty. Whilst the first penalty seemed clear cut, most observers were mystified as to what was the offence that led to the award of the second spot-kick. Joe Malin pulled off a great save from Sam MacKay’s second fiercely struck effort and there seemed some degree of poetic justice.

Although the Scorries were the more dangerous attacking force in the first quarter of the game, the Cattachs too had their chances in a second quarter that was characterised by spells of midfield play. Most notably, following a Brora right-wing move, Scott Graham’s attempt at goal was held on the ground at the near post by Wick keeper McCarthy and, after a goalmouth scramble, Graham found himself free on the right but ballooned his effort high, wide and not so handsome. The first half ended with Wick again threatening. Craig Gunn’s shot was held by Joe Malin after he was allowed to waltz through several defenders

Brora started the second period with their tails up. Craig Campbell was played in and was adjudged to have been marginally offside and a rasping 20 yard drive from young Scott Lisle

whistled narrowly wide of the far post. Scott Graham then headed a left-wing cross over the bar before Wick broke upfield in the 58th minute and were awarded their third penalty of the evening. This time Craig Gunn converted decisively to put the Harmsworth Park men 2 up.

Ten minutes later, the home side had the opportunity to halve the deficit when they were awarded a penalty following a foul on the right. Sid MacKay converted with aplomb to make it 1-2. The goal acted as a fillip to the home sideb who now took over the attacking initiative. Scott Lisle struck an ambitious long range drive well wide and then on 78 minutes Kyle MacLeod held off two Wick defenders, turned quickly and shot inches over the crossbar.

5 minutes from time emotions boiled over and a midfield brawl ensued that ended with Brora’s Craig Campbell and Wick’s Michael Steven and Danny MacKay finding their way into the referee’s notebook.

Brora continued to press to try and get something out of game and, on 90 minutes, they got back on level terms when Kyle MacLeod gleefully headed home a right wing cross. Brora’s James Ross then received a second yellow for a foul in the 94th minute but the Cattachs 10 men finished strongly with 2 goal-bound efforts kicked of the Wick line.

Brora will consider this as a point gained rather than 2 lost given the flow of the game and the absence of the spine
