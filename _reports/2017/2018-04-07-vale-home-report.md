Brora had a comfortable win against the Banff side in their effort to finish in the top 4 of the Highland League and qualify for next season’s IRN BRU Cup.

A brace from Steven ‘Sid’ MacKay in the first half and a second half effort from Kyle MacLeod secured the points for the home side.

Brora welcomed back Jamie Duff and Gavin Morrison was back after his suspension although Paul Brindle joined the lengthy list of injured absentees. So, behind Joe Malin, the back four was Jamie Duff, Mark Nicolson, Colin Williamson and Sid MacKay with James Pickles, Gavin Morrison, Scott Lisle and Martin MacLean in midfield with Craig Campbell continuing to partner Kyle MacLeod up front.

Deveronvale barely featured as an attacking force in the first half as the home side dictated play without having a particularly cutting edge apart from a 9th minute 20 yard drive over the bar by Martin ‘Digger’ MacLean and 10 minutes later Craig Campbell’s teasing right-wing cross was picked off Sid MacKay’s head by Vale keeper Grant Pennet. This was followed by a good 20 yard drive from Scott Lisle held by Pennet at the second attempt. Kyle MacLeod then drove a right-wing corner over the bar from 12 yards when well placed.

It looked like a goal was coming and it duly arrived in the 28th minute when Craig Campbell was felled in the box by Steven Davidson and Sid MacKay made no mistake from the spot to put the Cattachs 1-0 ahead. The one-way traffic continued and a sharp drive by Kyle MacLeod was held low to his left by Vale keeper Pennet. However, the Princess Royal Park outfit mounted their first attack on 35 minutes but Paul Sutherland’s right-wing cross was overhit and ran out for a throw in. Sutherland then was flagged offside as he chased a through ball. Kyle MacLeod then had his shot blocked after a right wing run and cross by Sid MacKay. However, Brora doubled their lead two minutes into added time when Sid MacKay’s 25 yard free kick beat the Vale keeper low at his near post.

The second half started with some sloppy defensive play by the home side who allowed both Steven Davidson and Grant Noble to threaten. Davidson headed a corner narrowly past the post and then Noble’s effort from a right wing corner flew inches wide of the post.

On 56 minutes, Vale keeper Pennet injured his ankle making a save and had to be replaced by substitute keep Errol Watson whose first job was to pick the ball out of the net! Kyle Macleod weaved past 3 Vale defenders in the inside left channel and dinked a beautiful chip over the keeper.

Brora were denied a blatant penalty in the 72nd minute when Kyle MacLeod was brought down in the box by Liam Forbes but, astonishingly, the referee waved play on. The Vale defender actually laughed with relief when he realised he was not being penalised but MacLeod didn’t see the funny side!

Brora then took their foot off the gas pedal in the last 10 minutes and were almost punished. Home keeper Joe Malin, widely considered to be the best custodian in the Highland League, was a virtual spectator for most of the match but showed his level of concentration by making a superb double stop late on from Grant Noble and Vale substitute Robert Scott to ensure the Cattachs ended the match with a clean sheet.

Although Brora played better than they did against Wick 3 days earlier, the match certainly felt a bit flat, almost like an end-of-season match. Brora were comfortable, and didn’t concede any penalties so they will be content with the 3 points.
