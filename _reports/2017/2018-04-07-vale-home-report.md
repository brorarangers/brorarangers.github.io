Goals from Steven Mackay and on form Kyle Macleod saw Brora earn a comfortable 3 points as the sun finally shone on Dudgeon Park.

The first 30 minutes of this match saw several close calls for Brora to open the scoring, but a rash challenge on Craig Campbell in the box allowed Steven Mackay to break the deadlock with a well taken penalty in the 28th minute.

It was Sid who doubled the score with a free kick in the dying moments of the first half.

A fine solo effort from young Kyle Macleod 10 minutes into the second half finished this game as a competition and earned Brora the 3 points ahead of three challenging meetings over the next 11 days.
