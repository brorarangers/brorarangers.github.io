Brora Ranges have their goalkeeper Joe Malin to thank for securing three points against Turriff United at Dudgeon Park on Saturday, the Cattachs eventually running out 3-2 winners.

Joe Malin produced three world-class saves as Turriff fought back from being 3-1 down, against a Brora side that were playing quite apathetically for much of the match.

It was the visitors that opened the scoring in the fifth minute when Adam Cross finished well as the ball played bagatelle across the Brora penalty area, with none of the Home defenders taking responsibility for clearing their lines. The first 15 minutes of the game belonged to Turriff as they continued to press for a second and only some wayward finishing prevented them from adding to their tally.

However as the first half progressed, Brora came more into the game and deserved their equaliser in the 17th minute with Kyle Macleod equalising from close range and it was he who doubled his account to score on the half hour mark with a clinical finish.

Brora made it 3-1 shortly after the break when Colin Williamson was on hand to head home from close range, to give Brora what should’ve been a comfortable position.

The Turriff youngsters clearly did not view the game as such, and in 60 minutes Nick Wozniak pulled a goal back, with a great strike having beat a flat footed Brora defence.

The remaining 30 minutes of the match, belonged entirely to Turriff who peppered the Brora goal with a barrage of shots, only to be foiled by some absolutely magnificent saves from man of the match Joe Malin.

Speaking after the game Brora centre forward Paul Brindle commented “our goalkeeper made two saves from close range headers  and another shot from distance that looked to be goal bound. However Joe is the best keeper in the league,because of saves like these and we are all greatly indebted to him for his performance”
