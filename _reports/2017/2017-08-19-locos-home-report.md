The last time Inverurie Locos visited Dudgeon Park in March, Brora Rangers swept the Harlaw Park men aside scoring eight times without reply in their defence of the Highland League Cup.

It was a very different story this time with Inverurie catching the Cattachs with two fast breaks that brought them all three points.

Brora centre back and captain Jamie Duff was at his brother’s stag do so the starting back four were John Pickles on the right, Mark Nicholson and Colin Williamson in the middle and Ally MacDonald on the left. In front of them were Zander Sutherland on the right, Gavin Morrison and Martin MacLean in central midfield and Andrew Greig on the left with Scott Graham and Kyle MacLeod up front. The pitch was in good condition to play football, sunshine with a blustery wind blowing diagonally across the field.

The home side started brightly and in the 5th minute Zander Sutherland sent a low cross right across the goalmouth but the waiting Kyle MacLeod was slow to react. A minute later Scott Graham was only inches away from connecting with an excellent long, diagonal free kick from the right. Inverurie were looking to hit Brora on the break with long through balls to the dangerous Neil Gauld who forced a corner on 10 minutes after good work on the right.

The match settled down into a pattern of Brora dominating possession without really hurting the well-marshalled Inverurie defence and the away side looking for the counter attacking outlets of Colin Charlesworth wide and Neil Gauld in the middle. Four minutes from the break, this tactic paid off when Andy Hunter’s through ball found Colin Charlesworth in space on the left. He advanced on goal and slid the ball under the advancing Brora keeper Daniel Hoban.

Brora continued to attack at the start of the second half forcing 2 successive corners but, as in the first half, there was no end product to trouble the resolute Locos defence. But then, on 50 minutes, after another Brora attack was cleared to Gavin Morrison, the stand-in captain unleashed a 25-yard thunderbolt of a volley that nestled in the net before Inverurie keeper Scott Mathieson could move. Morrison caught the ball beautifully and it was one of the most spectacular goas seen at Dudgeon Park for many a day.

The equaliser seemed to settle the home side and a couple of minutes later. Morrison’s free kick from midfield was headed just wide by Colin Williamson and shortly afterwards Scott Graham’s low drive from 22 yards was tipped round the near post by Locos keeper Mathieson. With 20 minutes left RossTokely shuffled his pack by bringing on Craig Gunn and Steven MacKay for Andrew Greig and Kyle MacLeod whilst Neil Cooper brought on Martin Laing for Jordan Leyden. Brora continued to attack, committing more men forward in an effort to force a winner but, as often happens in such circumstances, this proved their undoing.

In the 78th minute, another long, probing ball on the right saw Neil Gauld on the shoulder of Brora’s last defender Steven MacKay. Disastrously for Brora, Sid slipped in the challenge and Gauld was away and one on one with young Brora keeper Daniel Hoban. The experienced striker took the ball wide of the advancing Hoban and tucked it into the unguarded net. Inverurie now ran down the clock by taking the ball wide to the channels and keeping possession. This all got too much for Gavin Morrison whose frustration saw him dive in two footed near the right touchline and received a straight red card for his trouble. This effectively ended Brora’s chances of nicking a late equaliser and a lone effort by Craig Gunn pulled wide of the far post was Brora’s last whimper.

Brora played well at times but not so well at other times. They are clearly not firing on all cylinders at the moment and the cutting edge seems to have deserted them.
