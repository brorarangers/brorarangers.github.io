Brora failed to collect the 3 points in a mid week trip to Inverurie as we yet again gifted a penalty to give the opposition a lead.

Neil Gauld's 28th minute penalty was cancelled out by one of Gavin's characteristic long range strikes just before half time. A Chris Angus goal in the 58th minute decided the outcome of the match however.
