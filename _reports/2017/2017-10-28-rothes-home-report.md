Brora Rangers had a comfortable 2-0 Highland League victory against Rothes at Dudgeon Park on Saturday, and they now head into the North of Scotland Cup Final with confidence levels high.

The wind was the real winner and match referee Billy Baxter, had a long look at conditions before giving the go ahead for the match to be declared playable.  

Brora started by far the brighter and immediately pressured the visitors goal, the clock had barely begun to countdown when Darren McConnachie had to make a fingertip save from the busy Zander Sutherland. Paul Brindle was using his pace and positional awareness well, but will have nightmares after missing what was a simple tap in. Some great interchange passing from Gavin Morrison and Sutherland saw the latter thread a perfect ball to Brindle who fleet of foot skiped around the goal keeper only to seemingly stumble when the empty goal beckoned and he saw the ball run harmlessly wide past the left hand post. This was a real let off for Rothes, but they themselves missed a golden opportunity within 3 minutes when Wilson really should have done better from 8 yards out, firing well wide after a miscue.

The action immediately flowed down to the Rothes goal once again when the luckless Brindle saw a very convertible chance strike the bar when he should really have done better. Brindle again was the villain 10 minutes later, when he picked up a cross ball from Sutherland, slipped his marker with aplomb, but rifled his shot into the side netting, with the goal at his mercy.

Brora took a deserved lead when Man of the Match, Mark Nicolson headed home in a crowded penalty area from a Morrison free kick wide on the left. This was no more than Brora deserved and went into the half time interval deservedly ahead.

Conditions did not improve in the second period, as is very often the case, the team with the wind to their backs found it difficult to control the ball and their passing. Like Rothes in the first period, the home side tended to overplay the ball, and whilst in full control of the game, Brora did not enjoy the dominance that they had in the first period, and were very nearly made to pay for not killing the game off earlier. A harmless looking cross from the left was not dealt with by the Brora defence and Davidson was allowed to get a looping header in,which assisted by the wind beat Mackay in the Brora goal but struck the upright and sailed out of play to safety.

With the clock running down Brora sealed the three points with an amazing 25 yard drive from Gavin Morrison. Picking up the ball from Duff, Morrison unleashed a wonderful  right footed strike which beat the Rothes keeper who barely moved, such was the power of the shot.

Speaking after the game Ross Tokely was delighted with the overall performance, but bemoaned the early missed opportunities when Brora should have put the result out of sight. "I thought we played some cracking football in the first half against the wind and we should of been 3 or 4 goals up at the break. It seems the story of the season not taking our chances but the fact we are creating opportunities in games is pleasing so we need to keep working hard in training and having the belief to be ruthless in front of goal". Rothes Manager Steven MacDonald commented "We were comprehensively outplayed in the first half and never got to grips with conditions. Brora were very effective for periods and we could have been 4 down at half time. However they didn't take their chances, and I felt we were much better in the second period and unlucky not to score late on. However Morrision's goal was worthy of winning any match"
