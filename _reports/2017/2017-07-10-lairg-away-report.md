Neither the spots of rain, nor the midgies, could dampen the spirits of players and supporters at Ferrycroft on Monday evening when Brora Rangers took a young team through to Lairg.

Manager, Ross Tokely, and our Head of Youth Development, Dale Pryde-MacDonald, travelled through to the Lairg Gala Week match along with a healthy away support for what was a highly entertaining game.

Dale's Development Squad were ably assisted by 1st team members James Ross, Lewis Grant, Will Counsell ,Cameron Lisle and Ross Tokely himself.

The reason for Lairg Rover's current table top position in the North West Sutherland AFA League was apparent.

However Brora Rangers started very strongly and quickly went into a 2-0 lead and could have doubled this, but the Lairg goalkeeper was on his game and the woodwork also saved the home side.

 Lairg Rovers regrouped and came back at Brora and deservedly pulled one back before half time.

 The second half saw the game swing from one end to another with chances at either end. Brora added another 3 and Lairg 2, to see the visitors run out 3-5 winners.

Brora scorers were; Lisle, Campbell,Griffiths,Webster and, much to the delight of the away support (and the frustration of the referee) Ross Tokely.

Speaking after the game Brora Chairman, William Powrie, thanked Lairg Rovers for their hospitality and the support that the people of Lairg give to Brora Rangers throughout the season, adding that it was a pleasure to come over to the Gala Week and play "The Wild Rovers".

For those looking for a pre-seaon match to give an indication of how Brora will fare in their quest for a 3rd League Championship, little will have been learned from this fixture. For Ross, Dale and William who have an eye on Youth Development within our Club, there were many positives to take away.

For all involved with Lairg Rovers, Lairg Gala Committee and the local community it was an event with no drawbacks, and The Rovers will, no doubt, take much encouragement from their strong comeback from their early disadvantage into what could have been anyone's game.

For those who sought an evening in the best of company and a match played in the spirit of friendship and mutual support of North football, we feel it was a mission well accomplished.

For Ross, well, we hope he recovers in time to do his usual running around the dugout for our meeting with [Ross County on Wednesday](/2017/07/12/ross-county-home/)

For the referee, Mr Dennis Bridgeford ... we were impressed that he ran the game dressed in a shirt and collar, and little else.

And for those that missed it, the Lairg midgies were in attendance, as most of our photos testify to.
