Brora Rangers progressed smoothly into the semi-finals of the North of Scotland Cup with a 4-0 win against Nairn County at Station Park on Wednesday evening.

In a game which Brora dominated 4 second half strikes secured their progress with goals from Mark Nicolson, Craig Campbell 2 and Zander Sutherland. It also merits mention that Brora struck the woodwork on no less than 4 occasions.

We'll be off to meet Forres Mechanics at Mosset Park on Wednesday 4th October in our bid to reach the final again. Meanwhile, just down the road, Golspie Sutherland will host Lossiemouth in the other semi-final tie.

Who fancies an all Sutherland North of Scotland Cup Final?
