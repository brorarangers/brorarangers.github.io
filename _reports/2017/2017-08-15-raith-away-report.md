Raith Rovers made it through to the second round of the Irn Bru Cup, but they were made to work hard for it by a Brora Rangers side who could consider themselves a little unlucky to lose by a 3-0 margin.

After matching their illustrious opponents for much of the match, a goal from Ross Callachan got Raith on their way in the first period, and second-half strikes from Lewis Vaughan and Yaw Osei eventually got Raith over the line. Considering Raith had had minimum fuss with Buckie Thistle as recently as last month, perhaps some home fans were expecting this match to progress in a similar way, but Brora made a bright start to this one, forcing three corners in the first couple of minutes, although Jamie Duff’s headed effort drifted harmlessly wide.

Rovers were struggling to get going in the opening period, although a nice piece of interchange between Bobby Barr and Kevin McHattie on the left, ended when the latter went down in the area under pressure from Scott Houston, with referee Steven Reid probably correctly seeing no need to award a penalty, despite the protestations of some.

Raith fashioned the first chance after eight minutes, when a short corner routine between Lewis Vaughan and Barr saw the winger send a cross into the area for Euan Murray, but his header was never in danger of troubling Brora goalkeeper, Daniel Hoban.

Neither ‘keeper had been particularly troubled in a fairly tame start to the match, although that changed in the 12th minute, when a magnificent stop by Aaron Lennox prevented Brora getting their noses in front.A sweeping ball in from Andrew Greig on the left-hand-side, found Scott Graham with almost the entire penalty box to himself, but with time to bring the cross down, he elected to try a first time effort, which Lennox tipped superbly past his right-hand post.

If Brora boss, Ross Tokely was frustrated at his team’s failure to capitalise, he had an even bigger reason to be annoyed just three minutes later, when Raith against the run of play  took the lead in the 15th minute with a well worked effort.Vaughan held the ball up by the left-corner flag, eventually releasing Barr who had arrived to help, and his cross into the area was met perfectly by the head of Ross Callachan, who thumped a header into the corner of Hoban’s net.

With Raith now a goal to the good, the home support were anxious for Raith to capitalise as the visitors pushed forward but Brora were proving obdurate and difficult opponents, and were creating as much as the home side, with Zander Sutherland seeing his effort blocked on the edge of the area by Berry.The away side also fashioned the final half-chance of the opening period, but Mark Nicholson’s effort from distance sailed high into the South Stand.

The second period ambled along in much the same fashion as the first, with Brora seeing plenty of the ball, but lacking the touch of incisiveness which Rovers had about them, albeit Smith’s team were being frustrated in their efforts.Vaughan has been at the hub of much of Rovers best efforts this term, and his low cross from the right was aimed towards Greig Spence, but Hoban gathered well at his near post.

It was as close as Rovers came in the first 20 minutes or so of the second period, as the home fans started to grow a little listless at the performance that was unfolding in front of them. However, Rovers doubled their advantage in the 65th minute, with a goal that could barely have been simpler.Barr played a ball over the top of the Brora defence, and with both Spence and Vaughan attempting to scamper on to it, the latter bided his time and lashed a volley past Hobdan to give Raith the breathing space they sought in the tie.

Indeed, Brora demonstrated just how much it was required, as they came agonisingly close to reducing the arrears three times in a matter of a few seconds.First, Nicolson was unlucky to see his fierce drive from distance strike the bar, and from the rebound, substitute Kyle MacLeod was twice denied by two fingertip stops from Lennox.These were two world class saves from the ex Aberdeen stopper and denied Brora the goal they richly deserved.

The match was put to bed with five minutes left however, when another substitute, Yaw Osei bagged his first goal for Raith.Again, it was all very straightforward, with Barr’s ball over the top catching the Brora defence somewhat flat-footed, and with Hobdan apparently unsure whether to stick or twist, Osei remained calm enough to take the ball around the ‘keeper, and slot home to make it three.

Despite the defeat, Ross Tokely was delighted with his Highland League's team efforts who received a standing ovation from the home support.
