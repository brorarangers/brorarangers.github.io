Although Brora have generally done well away to Nairn County in recent seasons, the Wee County have been troublesome opponents at Dudgeon Park and so it proved again in this encounter.

Although Brora eventually laid their home Nairn bogey, it was a ‘sair fecht’ to do so.

For the second home match in a row, the weather smiled on Dudgeon Park and the sides took the field in pleasant autumnal sunshine and on a lovely playing surface. The home side had Colin Williamson back in central defence with James Ross reverting to the bench and the other change saw Craig Gunn start up front in place of Paul Brindle.

The Cattachs started as if they meant business and after a couple of minutes a fast, incisive attack on the right saw Martin ‘Digger’ MacLean move the ball on to Craig Gunn who fired a low, hard ball right across the goalmouth. The cross was begging for a touch but it eluded everybody and the danger was cleared. Brora were enjoying the lion’s share of possession and kept the Nairn defenders on the back foot. On 11 minutes, the breakthrough came. From an Andrew Greig left wing corner, Colin Williamson met the ball emphatically with a diving header and bulged the net for the opening goal.

Although the home side were dominating possession, the visitors looked to break at all times and they committed numbers forward so that they posed a real threat to the Brora rear guard. Shortly after ‘Sid’ MacKay volleyed over the bar at the far post, Nairn mounted an attack of their own that ended with a cross being deflected for a corner. Brora continued to press and create chances. A 25-yard drive by centre back Mark ‘Twiggy’ Nicolson wasn’t far over the postage stamp corner. A lovely cross field ball by Andrew Greig on the left was nodded down by John Pickles into the path of Craig Gunn who blazed over the bar and a right-sided moved ended with Ally MacDonald shooting narrowly wide from the edge of the D.

Nairn came into their own towards the end of the first half. Jordan MacRae, the focal point of Nairn’s attacking play, was allegedly tripped on the edge of the box, although the Brora defence hotly contested the award of a free-kick. Notwithstanding, MacRae hit a beautiful dead ball and must have thought he’d equalised only for young Brora custodian Daniel Hoban to bring off a brilliant leaping save, clawing the ball away with his left hand. That must have deflated Nairn and lifted Brora’s spirits. And just before the interval, a left-wing break by the visitors saw Gary Kerr’s cross headed narrowly past his own post by Twiggy Nicolson under pressure from Jordan MacRae. So, although Nairn trailed at half time, they certainly went in at the break with their tails up.

The second half continued as the first half had ended – with Nairn in the ascendancy. The Wee County forced a series of corners with which the Brora defence found it difficult to cope and they were clearly losing some of their shape. A case of ‘don’t panic, Captain Mainwaring!’ However, the Cattachs weathered the storm and started making chances again at the other end. A raking cross field pass from Gavin Morrison to Andrew Greig saw ‘Chubs’ cross flashed a whisker past the far post by Craig Gunn. Another raking cross field ball to Andrew Greig – this time from Digger MacLean - saw Chubbs cut in and fire inches over the cross bar.

Just coming up to the hour, a Nairn break saw the ball finish in the Brora net but the flag had gone up early for a clear offside. The chalked off counter was to prove costly for Nairn because, 3 minutes later, Sid MacKay headed home Gavin Morrison’s right wing corner to double the Cattachs’ lead. In the first 15 minutes of the second period, Nairn had asked questions of the Brora rear guard and the initial answer was decidedly stuttering. Now, however, the stuttering had given way to fluency. Craig Campbell’s header was grasped at the far post by Nairn keeper Stephen Foster after another-left wing cross by Chubbs as the match settled back into the pattern of most of the first half.

On 65 minutes Ross Tokely switched his strikers, replacing Craig Gunn and Craig Campbell with the fresh legs of Scott Graham and Kyle MacLeod. The fact that both Brora goals were scored by the backs, confirmed that the strikers had not been at their best on the day.

Nairn continued to look dangerous on the break On 70 minutes, a long deep ball from midfield saw Dylan MacKenzie through one on one but, once again, Hoban averted the danger. He got a hand to MacKenzie’s shot and pushed it away for a corner and a few minutes later Garry Kerr got through and almost halved the deficit but was thwarted by desperate Brora blocks. After Nairn replaced Dylan MacKenzie with Max Ewan, the young Brora keeper once again broke the visitors’ hearts by bringing off a double leaping save to repel them, the second shot held under his own crossbar.

Brora replaced Ally MacDonald with James Ross with 5 minutes of normal time left, presumably because Ross Tokely was concerned enough about Nairn’s goal threat to shore up the defensive point of the midfield diamond as it was clear Nairn were as likely to score as Brora at this point. In the event, however, Brora made the 3 points safe in the 89th minute when Andrew Greig followed up a long cross field pass to the left which rolled out of the keeper’s hands and left Chubs with the simple task of rolling the ball into the empty net. It was a shame for Nairn keeper Stephen Foster because it was his only error of an otherwise competent display.

Another win for Brora to push them up the table and Nairn can take heart from the fact that they made life uncomfortable for the Cattachs for the most of this contest and created clear chances.
