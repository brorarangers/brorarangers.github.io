Brora Rangers continued their run of improved performances with a hard working but profitable performance against current P&J Highland League winners Buckie Thistle

Goals from Craig Campbell, Paul Brindle and Scott Graham secured all three points and sets the Cattachs up well ahead of their midweek clash with Clachnacuddin on Wednesday at Dudgeon Park.

Manager Ross Tokley speaking post match heaped praise on his players." Buckie are always a very difficult side to play against and I didn't sleep the previous night thinking about my best starting eleven. As it was the boys did themselves proud with a fully committed display, and I felt we fully deserved the victory. We are slowly finding our form and following the 4-0 cup win against Nairn County on Wednesday it was important that we followed up in a similar style. I wouldn't want to pick a man of the match, as we excelled in many parts of the park"

Buckie Manager Graeme Stewart was less than happy with team, whom he felt were second to many balls, and didn't show the same level of desire as the hosts.

Brora started the brighter with midfield enforcer Gavin Morrison seeing his fierce shot go narrowly wide. It was Morrison again who in the 9th minute picked out Jamie Duff from his free kick, but the big centre half saw his effort gathered by Bell in the Buckie goal.

Buckie themselves had a chance shortly after, when ex Cattach, Steven Ross won an ariel ball, but his header came back off the post and was cleared to safety by Mackay. However Brora were quick to respond when Paul Brindle won a clearance from Jamie Duff, and his onward header was well directed into the path of Craig Campbell who controlled the ball well and finished low to Bell's left to give Brora a well deserved lead.

Brora gradually took control of the middle of the park with Maclean, Morrison and Sutherland all a yard quicker to the ball than their visitors.

Brora should have doubled their lead when a magnificent cross field ball from Mackay, found Sutherland wide on the right flank. The jinky winger beat his marker and fired in a stunning low cross outwith the reach of the keeper, but somehow Brindle let the ball roll between his legs when less than a yard from an empty net.

The second half again started brightly for Brora, and they were rightly awarded a penalty after MacKinnon lunged at Campbell in the box. Paul Brindle stepped up to double the Brora advantage with a well taken spot kick. Buckie were also reduced to 10 men as referee Proctor gave Cheyne his marching order for dissent.

Buckie threw caution to the wind in search of a way back into the game, and had a shot and header trouble Hoban, but Brora sealed the win in the 84th minute when Greig picked out an unmarked Graham who calmly slotted the ball past the advancing Bell.
