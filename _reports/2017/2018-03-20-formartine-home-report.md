Brora failed to secure a final place berth, after going down 3-2 at home to Formartine United, in what was an exciting and robust game of football.

In a game which swung from end to end, Formartine had to endure a last 15 minute onslaught from Brora, and thanks to the woodwork, maintained their advantage to proceed through to the final where they will meet Fraserborough.

Brora started the brighter, with Paul Brindle and Zander Sutherland looking especially sharp upfront, although it was Formartine who had the first attempt at goal after seven minutes but Gary Wood hit his shot over the bar.

Formartine were awarded a penalty after 15 minutes when Colin Williamson pulled back Graham Roger, but Archie McPhee saw his spot kick brilliantly saved by Joe Malin, but in his efforts to clear the ball Brora defender Martin Maclean turned the ball back into his own net in a bizarre set of circumstances.

Formartine doubled their lead five minutes before half-time when a free-kick found its way through to an unmarked McPhee who thumped the ball home from close range.

The home side were quick to respond and a James Ross cross found Paul Brindle who headed home to ensure that Brora went into the half-time interval just the one goal in arrears.

Formartine started the second half the more positive and again Joe Malin was called upon to make a fingertip save from Rodgers header. However referee Alan Proctor awarded a second penalty to Formartine shortly afterwards again against Williamson whom he judged to have tripped Barbour . This time Former Brora player Craig Mckeown powerfully converted the spot kick to give Formartine a two goal cushion.

With 25 minutes remaining, Zander Sutherland drilled a ball across the face of the goal after some excellent work on the wing, and his cross was mishandled by Main into his own net to restore the difference to just one, and put Brora right back into contention.

Despite an onslaught by Brora in the last 15 minutes, and several missed chances, the visitors defence held firm and it is they that advance into the final.
