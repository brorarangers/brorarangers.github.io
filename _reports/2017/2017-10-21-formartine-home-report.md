We've handed out a couple of 5 goal victories in recent weeks, this weekend it was our turn to be on the wrong end of one.

In what could have been a 13 game unbeaten streak, it appeared to be more than a dose of bad luck which saw Brora become unstuck against a strong performance from Formartine Utd.

Early goals from Gary Wood and Scott Barbour within the opening 7 minutes put Brora very much on the back foot right from the get go. Graeme Rodger added to the visitors tally on the half hour mark.

Andrew Greig replaced Paul Brindle before half time, and Craig Gunn and Zander came on for Cammy and Ally Macdonald early in the second half. For a short period of time the Reds seemed to be battling their way back into the game.

However, a red card for Steven Mackay turned an uphill task into mission impossible.

Further goals from Liam Burnett and Scott Ferries ensured the 3 points left on the bus to Pitmedden and Formartine fans feeling very much avenged for the match back in March 2015 where the scoreline was reversed
