East Fife may not quite be the force they were of old, Brora Rangers made their own little piece of history when they defeated the past cup winners 1-0 in Methil on Saturday to progress to the fifth round of the Scottish Cup for the first time in their history.

A 12th minute goal from Colin Williamson was enough to carry the Cattachs forward to a lucrative tie against Premier League side Kilmarnock in Ayrshire on the 10th February.

Having beaten Stranraer in the previous round, Brora arrived at Bayview in a confident frame of mind and well prepared to face their League One opponents, having fully researched and documented the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition.

The artificial surface insured the game went ahead despite the very wintry conditions although underfoot conditions remained very difficult throughout the match.

Supported by a noisy band of followers numbering 250 strong,  Brora started the game in the most positive of manners and did not allow their higher league opponents to settle at all. The first chance of the match fell to Brora and Scott Graham was very unlucky not to open the scoring when his shot beat the East Fife goalkeeper, but defender Jonathan Page was on the goal line to clear the ball away.

Brora then had a series of corners, maintain pressure on the home goal and the game was only 12 minutes old when central defender Colin Williamson popped up to head home a Gavin Morrison corner to give the visitors a well deserved lead.

It was Colin Williamson who again was in the thick of the action but this time in is own penalty area when he threw himself head long to block a goal bound strike by Chris Duggan the East Fife marksman. The remainder of the first half was a strategic battle for the midfield, where Morrison and Nicholson were dominant for Brora and indeed Morrison was unfortunate to see his strike sale just passed the post after 40 minutes.  As referee David Munro blew the whistle for half time the home side left the field to a series of hoots from the home supporters who knew that Brora were  hungrier and more motivated than their own players.

East Fife manager X would certainly have given his team a tongue lashing at the break, as the home side came out for the second half with much more purpose and Brora were forced to take a defensive position. Smith, Wilkie and Linton all had speculative long-range effort at goal, although none troubled Brora keeper Joe Malin who was enjoying a relatively quiet spell between the sticks.

East Fife were handed a golden opportunity to equalise when a Steven Mackay backpass fell short of the keeper but Chris Duggan was unable to control the ball and his effort went into the side netting.

As the clock ticked down it was a case of “man the pumps” for the Brora defence, but the Fifers front line could not find a way through the Brora back rearguard. The dangerous Scott Linton saw his curling free kick crash against the outside of Malin’s goalpost and substitute Kyle Wilson signed that morning from St Johnstone should have made more of his shot from 15 yards, but he miscued badly.

Brora hero Colin Williamson had to leave the field with 10 minutes remaining following a head injury which required medical attention. The rearranged Brora defence managed to hold out, repelling everything the visitors could throw at them and despite an endless 5 minutes of added time, David Munro eventually blew for full time to send the travelling Reds, pipes and drums included into delirium.

Brora Captain Jamie Duff commented, no one gave us a chance. East Fife started in the same way that Stranraer did and that they thought they could turn up and stroll about the park. You would think that we would have been given a little more respect especially having won at a League One side in the last round. Perhaps as it was such a cold day they were not up for it, but they soon realised that they were up against a side  who were fully focused and motivated. I thought we were well worth our lead at half-time.”

Duff continued “ their manager must’ve given them a rocket at half time because they played a lot better in the second half. Craig Thompson came on and gave them a lift. I played with him at Elgin and you could see the pace and quality he had.

He gave us problems and we rode our luck a little bit towards the end but most of their chances came through our mistakes, but we managed to hold on to achieve a wonderful result.

Our fans created a great atmosphere and motivated us most when we were up against it. They know us and we know them and this has created a great family club and our celebrations at the end of the match were priceless to all of us, players and supporters alike.”

Manager Ross Tokley said “we have made history. That is terrific,it means a lot to everybody at the club and to the Chairman as it will help the overall financial position of the club. For a part-time team in the Highland League it is a special result and being in the last 16 is great.

It will take a while to sink in, although the boys were really enjoying themselves in the changing room afterwards. We were a little lucky in the second half as they had chances but sometimes you have to sit back during Scottish Cup games and this is what we did,and did it well.”
