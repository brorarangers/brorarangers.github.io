Both teams will have left the Victoria Park pitch thinking that was two points dropped, but the neutral observer would have called the draw an equitable result in a game that did the Press & Journal Highland League great credit.

On a day when only this and one other game beat the weather, the 500 spectators were warmed by a game which swung from end to end, delivered 4 goals, some missed opportunities and great saves from each goalkeeper.

Brora brought recent signing James Pickles into their starting line up in the absence of suspended Ally MacDonald. The game was given extra spice with the inclusion into the Buckie line up of Ex Cattachs striker Steven Ross.

The game started slowly but it was Brora that had the early chances, with Duff and Nicolson both going close. At the other end Jay Cheyne saw his shot sail over the bar after some nice build up play from the home side.

It was the Jags who opened the scoring after 21 minutes. It was Cheyne  who  was the man on target, after he connected well with a Robertson cross. The goal certainly galvanised Buckie and and they pushed forward with purpose for a second. However Brora were dangerous on the counter and Brindle saw his shot cleared off the line, but Mackay was on hand to level for the visitors to ensure the sides went in at the break all square.

Brora keeper was quickly called into action following the restart, and Malin made a wonderful blocking stop to deny Steven Ross. He continued to be kept busy, as Buckie searched for a second, and he foiled a thunderbolt from Shaun Carroll.

Despite Buckie being in the ascendancy it was far from one way traffic and Steven Mackay saw his header just fall wide with the Buckie keeper beaten.

Brora continued to press and Martin MacLean had a wayward effort fly wide, but on 81 minutes his strike struck the underside of the bar, and substitute Scott Graham was on hand to give Brora the lead.

Buckie immediately pressed for the leveller, and on 85 minutes Brora conceded a needless free kick, some 25 yards out  at the side of the penalty box. From the resultant kick MacAskill sent a curling strike across the defence and into the net.

As the clock ticked down, Buckie squandered two gilt edged chances to secure all 3 points.

Brora Manager Ross Tokely was disappointed that his side once again concerned late, but acknowledged Buckie could have stolen it at the death.

This Saturday Brora travel to Inverness to take on Clachnacuddin at Grant Street.
