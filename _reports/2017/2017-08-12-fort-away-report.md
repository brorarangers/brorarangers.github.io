Brora Rangers captured all three points on offer with a comprehensive 4-0 victory away at Fort William on Saturday.

Brora began in an uncompromising manner, forcing a well organised Fort William onto the back foot from the off, and it was no surprise to see them take the lead when the unfortunate Richard Tawse put through his own goal whilst under pressure from Steven Mackay after 14 minutes.

Brora were unlucky not to double their lead shortly thereafter but Macleods effort brought out a great save by the Fort William goalkeeper. However it was merely a reprieve for the home side as Macleod struck with a double on 23 and 45 minutes, ensuring the Cattachs went in at the break 3-0 to the good.

Fort William reorganised after the interval, moving five into their back line, and set their stall out for a damage limitation exercise and in the main their tactics worked.

On the stroke of full time Andrew Greig added a fourth to the scoresheet, which added a more reflective hue to the match result.

Speaking after the match Brora Manager Ross Tokely was pleased with the 3 points, and in general with the way the afternoon went. "We started the game really well, using the width of the park and were unlucky not to have had far more than the three in the first half. They certainly changed things around in the second half, and it was frustrating that our finishing was not where it should have been. They defended well and their young keeper Martin Mackinnon had a great game with some fantastic stops, but we need to be able to counter these tactics better,as we are seeing them every week at the moment. We are working hard and will continue to do so on our finishing, but 4-0 away from home is a good result by any measure."
