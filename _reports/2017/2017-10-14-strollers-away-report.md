So far, so good as far as our William Hill Scottish Cup campaign goes. Goals for: 10; Goals against: 0. And the 3rd Round beckons.

It was a bright start for Brora with both Gavin and Paul Brindle disappointed to see their efforts come to nothing. Craig Campbell was similarly dissapointed on the half hour mark not to make more of a cross from Scotty Graham.

Perseverance paid off shortly afterwards as a well worked attack from Maclean and Macdonald sent a cross into the Strollers box which Scotty headed neatly into the corner of the home sides net.

And so we went in at half time, a goal to the good, but aware that despite the squandered chances it had been a pretty even first half.

Cue the Tokely team talk.

Less than 5 minutes into the second half a cross from Sid wasn't cleared by the Strollers' defence and fell to the feet of Ally Macdonald, who rifled a low shot beyond the fingertips of Burnside.

The favour was returned on the hour mark when a Macdonald corner was headed into the goal by Sid.

Scott Graham picked up his second goal of the game with a fantastic free kick from the edge of the D seven minutes later.

Whilst Brora were now completely domnant, the Strollers had a couple of chances to get themselves on the scoresheet, and it was obvious that they hadn't given up. However, an injury time goal for Paul Brindle completed the perfect day out for the army of Brora fans who made the trip to the 'Burgh.

Many thanks to Graham Farquhar for the use of his photos, and a huge thanks to our travelling support. If Edinburgh wasn't far enough away for you, fear not ... the next road trip is only a couple of redraws away.
