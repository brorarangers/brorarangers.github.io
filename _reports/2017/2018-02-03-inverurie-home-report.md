On a pitch which passed two inspections. a Scott Graham double
helped steer Brora Rangers into the first round proper of the Breedon
Highland League Cup.

First half goals from Graham and John Pickles put Brora in the
driving seat before Neil Gauld pulled one back for Locos early in the
second half. But after a sticky spell on a heavy pitch Brora finished
strongly with another goal from Graham and an own-goal courtesy of
Locos’ keeper Andy Reid.

Brora got off to a flyer with a goal after just four minutes.
A long ball from Ally MacDonald found Graham who side-stepped
his marker and coolly slotted the ball past Reid.
The home side created another opening in the 10 th minute when a
Kyle MacLeod flick-on set up Martin MacLean but his effort was
well saved by Reid at the near post.

Locos came more into the tie as the half wore on and Martin Laing
tested Joe Malin in the Brora goal with a snap shot after Connor
Rennie picked him out. Neil McLean then had a turn and shot from
outside the 18-yard box which flew wide of Malin’s right hand post.
It was Brora’s turn to threaten and after a Pickles shot in the 33 rd
minute was blocked in front of goal, Graham fired a shot just wide of
the upright.

But Brora doubled their lead three minutes later when Pickles won the
ball back on the edge of the area and he fired a low shot into the far
corner of the net.

Graham who was playing with all the flair of an exotic South
American came close again when he turned a MacLeod cross past
Reid’s left hand post three minutes from the break.

Locos made a couple of changes at half time and they were back in
the tie in the 48 th minute when Chris Angus swung a ball over from
the left and Gauld was left with a simple finish.

Brora responded with a driving run from MacLean before his lay-off
was blasted wide of target by MacLeod.MacLean had another chance
in the 55 th minute when his attempted lob flew wide of goal.

Paul Brindle, who had come on as a sub a minute earlier, made an
instant impact when his cut back was fired high into the net by
Graham for his second of the tie in the 66 th minute.

It got worse for Locos six minutes later when Reid fumbled a
MacDonald corner into his own net.

Brora came close to adding to their lead but MacKay fired over from
close range and Brindle forced a point-blank save from Reid after the
keeper clawed away a shot from Craig Campbell.
