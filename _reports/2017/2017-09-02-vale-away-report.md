Brora Rangers were given a real scare at Banff on Saturday when a hard working and enthusiastic young Deveronvale side ran them right to the final whistle.

In a game which would have been enjoyable to the neutral, the first 45 minutes was full of end to end incident, 4 goals, numerous defensive mistakes by both goalkeepers and defences,  and the woodwork being rattled 3 times as the pendulum swung from one penalty area to the other. The second period was equally exciting, with Brora Rangers dominant, but it was not until an 80th minute headed winner that the points were secured for the Cattachs.

As is often the case, Brora started the game very brightly and Zander Sutherland was operating across the front line, and causing the home defence many problems. Indeed it was Sutherland who had the first attempt at goal but his shot went narrowly wide. However Brora had only to wait until the 12th minute before taking a deserved lead when Scott Brown connected to a Williamson pass and beat Grant Pennet in the Deveronvale goal.

The home side found themselves level within two minutes when an uncharacteristic sloppy half clearance by Hoban, only found Dane Ballard who lobbed the ball back over the stranded Brora goalkeeper. Within 3 minutes Ballard played a great ball into the box and Paul Sutherland fished with aplomb high into the Brora net with a rasping shot.

Finding themselves 2-1 down, Brora streamed forward and both Sutherland and Graham forced great saves from Pennet . Back up the other end Deveronvale were looking dangerous and Robert Scott rattled the post with a fine effort.

Brora enjoyed a piece of good fortune for their equaliser when keeper Pennet was walking the ball out of his box, only to take an air shot at it and the on hand Paul Brindle simply walked the ball around him and into the empty net.

Brora were unlucky not to quickly add a third, but a Mark Nicolson free kick dipped over the defensive wall and off the underside of the crossbar with the keeper well beaten.

Both Managers would have had concerns at half time, and not unexpectedly the second period was a far more cagier affair, with both teams unwilling to over commit up front for fear of getting caught on the break. Brora in the main dominated the second session without looking as if a goal was imminent, but substitute Greig was certainly making his presence felt down the left wing with some telling runs and crosses.

However it was from a corner that Brora broke the deadlock with a Colin Williamson power header from a perfectly placed Scott Graham corner.

Brora held out for the remaining 15 minutes to secure all three points.
