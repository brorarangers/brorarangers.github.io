Goals from Kyle Macleod, Paul Brindle, Gavin Morrison and Craig Campbell saw Brora Rangers claim a victory in the first of our Pre-Season friendly matches.

Brora's starting line up of Joe Malin, James Ross, Colin Williamson, Jamie Duff, Martin Maclean, Mark Nicolson, Scott Lisle, Steven Mackay, Andrew Greig, Paul Brindle and Kyle Macleod looked eager from the get go.

Kyle opened the scoring in the 12th minute, with Paul Brindle scoring from the penalty spot in the 36th minute. And there the scoreline remained as the half time whistle was blown.

Will Counsell took over goalkeeping duties for the second half, with Ross, Williamson, Duff, Scott Lisle, Brindle and Macleod also giving way to Cameron Lisle, Ally Macdonald, Craig Campbell, Craig Gunn, Gavin Morrison and Scott Graham.

Half an hour into the second half Gavin Morrison made it 3 from a fantastic strike from outside the box, and Craig made the scoresheet again almost on the stroke of full time.

Next up, it's [Inverness Caledonian Thistle](/2017/07/04/caley-thistle-home/) at Dudgeon Park on Tuesday evening.
