Grabbing the icy blasts falling from the Cairngorm plateau, few would have been surprised at Strathspey being unable to host our game this weekend.

Hey ho. It's a rest week for players and spectators alike. Next up it's the fellow mountainous Highland League Club. It's a home game on the balmy East Coast, so keep your fingers crossed.
