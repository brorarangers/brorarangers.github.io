Once again this season the weather was to get the better of Brora Rangers but this time it was not snow and ice but exceptionally high winds and driving rain.

The wind had threatened the postponement of the Breedon Highland League Cup preliminary round against Inverurie Loco’s , but match referee David Watt, gave the fixture every chance, but after just four minutes the white flags were raised as the players retreated from the field of play, with the game being abandoned.

The Inverurie Manager Neil Cooper was supportive of the decision to abandon the match.

He said “the referee spoke to us before the game and he was concerned about the high winds. He told us he would start the game and see how it went, but it was not long before the conditions deteriorated further and he had no option but to abandon the match”. Brora boss Ross Tokley was also fully supportive of the decision, not wanting such an important game to turn into a lottery.

It is very unfortunate on Inverurie and their supporters, who will have to make the 300 mile round trip once again this Saturday, but no doubt hoping that weather conditions will be more clement.

Brora were quick to arrange a midweek friendly, when they took on Tain St Duthus in Dingwall on Monday evening. An excellent workout resulted in a 6-2 win for Brora Rangers.
