After a bright start, Brora’s makeshift side were eventually well beaten by Fraserburgh who came away with the 3 points and ended a run of 5 consecutive defeats.

The first exchanges were tentative and mainly in midfield. After the Broch’s Gary Harris had an early chance with a low shot from 15 yards saved by Brora keeper Joe Malin’s legs, at the other end Mark Nicolson’s fierce free kick cleared the crossbar.

The Cattachs took the lead on 17 minutes. Sid MacKay won a corner on the left and Mark Nicolson rose to head Gavin Morrison’s inviting ball in from the 6 yard line. Brora could and should have doubled their lead on 26 minutes after Broch defender Lewis Davidson miscued in attempting to clear. The ball broke to Martin ‘Digger’ MacLean in the left channel but Digger blasted his shot straight at Broch keeper Peter Tait. Just a minute after this the home side again thought they had doubled their lead. Sid MacKay, in the same inside left channel as Digger went for placement rather than power and lobbed the advancing Tate. Just as Sid wheeled away to celebrate, Ryan Cowie raced in to clear off the line. At this point, Brora were in the ascendancy and looking the more dangerous side.

However, the Bellslea Park men made Brora pay for their earlier profigacyin front of goal as in the 32nd minute they equalised. Following a Broch attack and cross Ryan Cowie ran onto the ball an drove the ball firmly into the net. A mere 2 minutes after this, Fraserburgh took the lead from their next attack when Greg Buchan beat Joe Malin with a composed lob from 10 yards.

Brora began the second half by forcing the pace and Colin Williamson’s long range drive was narrowly past the post. However, five minutes into the second period, Fraserburgh stretched their lead with another fine goal. Graham Johnston’s left wing cross was met with an emphatic header by Bryan Hay. This goal put the Broch’s tails up and some of the swagger of earlier in the season when they were challenging for the title came back into their play. Conversely, it took the wind out of the makeshift Cattach side’s sails.

The home side were now struggling to pick up their men when defending set pieces and the dangerous Hay was unmarked when he met Ryan Cowie’s right wing free kick and headed just over the bar. Brora did rally, exhorted to redouble their efforts by Sid MacKay. On 64 minutes, Sid almost reduce the deficit when he lofted a left wing cross over the bar from 2 yards as he was falling.

The difference in the morale of both sides was evident for the last quarter of the match. Brora were second to almost every ball and slower in their reactions and the visitors had no further scares in front of goal and comfortably saw out the match until the full time whistle.
