Brora Rangers progressed to the 2nd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup with a comprehensive 5-0 victory over Girvan FC on Saturday.

Goals from Paul Brindle, Craig Gunn and an Andrew Greig hat-trick ensured it wasn't just the great Saturday afternoon weather that put a smile on the faces of the home support.

Round 2 will see us travel to Edinburgh to meet Civil Service Strollers on the 14th October.
