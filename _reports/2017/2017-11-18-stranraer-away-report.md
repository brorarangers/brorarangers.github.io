For those who left Brora at 6am on a supporters bus bound for Stranraer on Saturday morning, the rewards far outweighed the thought of a 20 hour day for 97 minutes of thrilling football.

Brora started brightly, testing Stranraer keeper, Cameron Belford, a couple of times in the opening minutes.

The Cattachs kept up the pressure throughout the first 45 minutes. Despite half time seeing both sides goaless, the travelling support certainly felt they were backing the stronger team.

Stranraer showed more determination in the second half and the end to end football continued with both ides creating chances. Ryan Thomson managed to get the ball beyond Joe Malin 15 minutes from the end, but referee Cook blew for a foul.

A the clocked ticked down, a draw, and a replay at Dudgeon Park appeared to be the likely outcome ... until Sid cut out a stray pass on the halfway line and took matters into his own hands (or feet).
