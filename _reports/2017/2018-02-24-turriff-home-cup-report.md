A Paul Brindle double guided Brora Rangers into the quarter-finals of
the Breedon Highland League Cup after a dominant display against a
young Turriff United side at Dudgeon Park.

Brora started the match brightly with the home side forcing a
succession of corners in the first quarter without threatening the
Turriff goal to any extent.

In Brora’s best chance of the first half centre back Jamie Duff
launched a long ball up front but Steven MacKay’s flick on was
blazed over the bar by Ali MacDonald,who should really have done
better.

Yet another corner for Brora in the 23 rd minute almost produced the
opener. But when the ball fell for Mark Nicolson his bullet header
failed to test Turriff keeper Aaron Sherman.

It was one-way traffic and another chance fell for Paul Brindle four
minutes later. The Brora forward got on the end of a John Pickles’
cross but he hooked his effort high and wide.

In a rare attack Turriff’s Robert Allan curled in a dangerous ball
which Joe Malin in the Brora goal had to watch carefully as it dipped
over the crossbar. Most of the action was at the other end and Brindle
headed a Nicolson ball over and a minute later Steven MacKay
flashed a header wide from a Sutherland free kick.

The chances kept coming and MacKay fired over at the back post
after a MacDonald cross found its way through a crowded box and
went all the way through to him.

The score remained level at the interval, with the visitors happy that
they had been able to hold their line against the dominant home side.
The second half continued much in the same vein with Brora
continuing to dominate and the home side won a free kick on the
edge of the area in the 47 th minute. However, Nicolson failed to test
Sherman with a weak shot.

Brora finally made the breakthrough in the 55 th minute. Brindle was
nudged in the box by David Booth and referee Alan Proctor pointed
to the spot. Brindle took the kick himself and sent Sherman the wrong
way with a well taken penalty.

Martin MacLean had the chance to double the lead just after the hour
when he raced clean through on goal but Sherman came out to the
edge of his box to claim the ball.

Brindle made sure there was no way back for Turriff in the 83 rd
minute when he cut inside from the left and buried the ball beyond the
Turriff keeper for a decisive second goal.

Brora will play Keith at Kynoch Park in the next round on Saturday,
March 10.
