Brora Rangers final home league game was a much more robust and competitive affair than one would have expected for a match with not much at stake.

Brora will finish in sixth position irrespective of the results of their 3 remaining fixtures or results elsewhere. Huntly will finish in comfortable mid-table and their main incentive was to halt a sequence of six consecutive defeats at Dudgeon Park.

With Ross Tokely back in the home dugout and naming himself among the substitutes, the Cattachs line up had a more settled look with a backline of James Ross, Colin MacRae, Colin Williamson and a more withdrawn Gavin Morrison in front of Joe Malin. Scott Lisle, Martin MacLean and James Pickles were in midfield with Steven ‘Sid’ MacKay well advanced in support of Craig Campbell and Kyle MacLead.

The home side looked more purposeful than of late as they attempted to end a 3 game losing streak and Kyle MacLeod’s drive from the left edge of the box was held by Huntly keeper John Farquhar. Sid MacKay then headed a right wing corner well over the angle of post and bar followed by Craig Campbell ‘s shot from 14 yards shaving the bar after good work on the right by Kyle MacLeod.

Brora continued to make all the chances but on the half hour mark, Huntly’s Cameron Booth suffered a serious injury. Both he and Brora’s Kyle MacLeod challenged for a dropping high ball around the halfway line. MacLeod put his boot up to try and flick on just as Booth stooped to try and get his head to the ball. MacLeod’s boot caught Booth’s face and resulted in a broken cheekbone for the Huntly man who was replaced by Reece McKeown. MacLeod received a yellow card for his raised foot but both players had their eyes on the ball at all times and there was no malicious intent.

The Strathbogie side’s players were now handing out some meaty challenges to MacLeod who responded by getting on with his game. There was also a flare up on halfway between several players with Brora’s Colin Williamson and Huntly’s Glen Murison being lectured by the referee. Kyle MacLeod’s pass to Sid MacKay resulted in a cross-shot that was deflected past for a corner and just before halftime, MacLeod’s goal bound diving header from Gavin Morrison’s left wing corner was blocked by a Huntly defender who didn’t know much about it.

The referee’s whistle for the interval gave a chance for tempers to cool. Although Brora had all of the chances, Huntly stopper Farquhar did not have that many saves to make.

The second half continued in the same vein with Brora making and missing chances with Craig Campbell being the sinner in chief. Firstly, he ballooned Martin ‘Digger’ MacLean’s low left wing crossover the bar. Then his effort from Sid MacKay’s cross was pawed wide by Farquhar and the follow up was pushed away. Then his shot from Scott Lisle’s pass on the right was blocked.

Despite being thwarted thus far, the Cattachs had an excellent opportunity to break the deadlock on the hour mark when Kyle MacLeod was brought down on the right hand side of the box by Huntly central defender Cory Ritchie. The normally reliable Sid MacKay stepped up to take the penalty but John Farquhar flung himself to the right to push away the spot kick, so we remained goal-less.

Although the Black and Golds had not been seen as an attacking force up to this point, they did finally give some work to the unemployed Joe Malin in the Brora goal in the 72nd minute when he made a fine save at the far post following a rare Huntly breakaway that ended with Neale Davidson’s firm goal bound drive.

Five minutes later, the visitors went even closer with a double chance. Firstly, Reece MacKeown’s shot from a right wing cross was saved at the far post by Joe Malin and Ryan Stewart failed to apply a finishing touch to the follow up cross. Having survived this scare, the home side resumed being in the ascendancy and Sid MacKay’s header from a leftwing cross just cleared the crossbar.

Just as the game seemed to be petering out to a goal-less draw, 33 minutes from the end yet another Brora attack saw Gavin Morrison’s right wing cross headed into his own net by Huntly’s Christopher Hay under pressure from Martin MacLean in a real goalmouth stramash. On 90 minutes, Gavin Morrison wared Huntly keeper Farquhar’s solar plexus with a fierce 25 yard drive and that was that – a hard-earned 3 points for the home side.

It’s been a long time since Brora Rangers lost 10 games in a league season and with 3 more games still to play. There is currently a pervading sense of what might have been given the run of season-ending injuries to vital players making up the spine of the team .

But if we look at the season overall, Brora won the North of Scotland Cup again, the 3rd time in the last 4 years. They reached the last 16 of the Scottish Cup for the first time in their history. They lost by the odd goal in the Highland League Cup semi-final to the eventual winners. Sixth is their lowest league placing for some years. Most teams would bite your hand off for such a season.
