Brora Rangers retained their hold on the North of Scotland Football Association Cup with a 2-0 victory over a hard working Lossiemouth side at Grant Street Inverness on Saturday.

Two second half goals by Martin Maclean and substitute Kyle Macleod  sealed the tie after a goalless first half in which Brora created but failed to convert many opportunities.

Referee Dan Macfarlane was taking charge of his first senior final and in the main controlled well a hard fought but fair game with both sides up for the challenge. On a dry, sunny but increasingly cold afternoon the Cattachs lined up with recalled Craig Gunn and Paul Brindle leading the forward line and James Ross retaining his spot at right back. Steven Mackay was on the bench following his suspension with Ally MacDonald dropping into left back. Influential Mark Nicolson had to sit the game out due to his ban for being sent off against Forres Mechanics in the semi-finals.

Brora were first into their stride and quickly took control of the midfield, with Gavin Morrison and Martin MacLean dominating their manor and creating some great ball for the forwards to latch onto.

Brora really should have put the tie to bed in the first half but Brindle, Graham, Gunn and Sutherland failed to convert good opportunities whilst ultra reliable Colin Williamson headed over the bar when to all it appeared to be a simple opportunity for the opener. Brora keeper Cammy MacKay, had a quiet first half, handling in regulation style the few Lossiemouth shots which came his way.

Midway through the first half, Craig Gunn had to be taken off, feeling ill and dizzy following a earlier tackle. He was replaced by Kyle Macleod making his return following a head injury last month.

The second half started in similar vein to the first with Brora pinning Lossiemouth deep in their own half.

Brora opened the scoring after 58 minutes. Paul Brindle picked up the ball on the left, cut inside and played a short ball to Martin Maclean, who from the edge of the box, side footed a well positioned shot around the Lossiemouth defence and low into the corner of the net, beating the outstretched Stewart Black in the Lossiemouth goal.

Black continued to foil the Cattachs pulling off a string of amazing acrobatic saves, one in particular to deny Kyle Macleod who launched a towering header goal-ward only to see Black launch himself across the goal to push the ball over for a corner.   

Lossiemouth will feel they missed a golden opportunity to equalise when Noble found himself in the clear. However Mackay in the Brora Rangers goal was very quick to come out and close the strikers options down. The score remained at 1-0 and that was to be the Coasters last chance.

In the final minutes of the game Kyle Macleod added a second goal when Black failed to hold a Brindle cross.

Speaking after the game, Manager Ross Tokely paid credit to his players. "We had prepared well for the match and knew that Lossiemouth would defend in numbers and try to catch us on the break. I was delighted with how we approached the game, and had it not been for an outstanding performance from their keeper we would certainly have scored several more. I thought Martin's finish was outstanding and Cammy MacKay did what he had to when making a great save late in the second half.

We deserved the win and it's wonderful to reward the fantastic support with the first piece of silverware of the season."

In a quirk of the fixture calendar Brora  entertain Lossiemouth on League business at Dudgeon Park on Saturday.
