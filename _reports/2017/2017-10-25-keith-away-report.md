Brora returned home from Kynoch Park with the 3 points on Wednesday night. As far as League position goes, that was a 'job done'.

A goal from Colin Williamson in the 25th minute broke the deadlock, only for stalemate to settle back in again.

In a game with little sparkle, our return to 4th place in the League after the heavy defeat at the weekend is what really matters.

Results elsewhere in the League helped to some extent ... whether the result between Rothes and Cove Rangers was in our favour remains to be seen this Saturday.
