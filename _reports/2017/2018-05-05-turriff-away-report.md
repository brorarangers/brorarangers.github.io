It was a young makeshift Brora Rangers side that showed great courage and fight to sign the season off with a 2-0 win away to a good Turriff United

With Joe Malin, Cameron Lisle, Scott Lisle, Scott Houston, John Pickles, Ally MacDonald, Colin Williamson, Jamie Duff, Martin Maclean, Scott Graham, Zander Sutherland and Paul Brindle all absent through injury the result was especially encouraging for next season.

On the best weather day since October, it was a warm and sunny day in Aberdeenshire, and with the pitch firming up and at the end of a heavy season, underfoot conditions were not ideal but both sides combined to provide an open and entertaining game of football in front of a large crowd in excess of 350.

The Cattachs started very brightly and deservedly took the lead after 12 min when trialist Kyle Maclean blasted home from the edge of the penalty area. His shot took a deflection but the Turriff keeper Aaron Sherman was never going to get to the ball which nestled into the bottom corner of the net.

Victory was however not sealed until the 90th minute when an unfortunate Ross Anderson lobbed the ball over his own keeper whilst under pressure from striker Kyle Macleod.

In what was a thoroughly entertaining well refereed game, where both sides created chances, Brora were by far the dominant side in the first half and deserved to go into the half time break further ahead. However Turriff emerged for the second period determined to claim a point and both Nicolson and fellow centre back under 20’s youngster Colin Macrae were made work for their corn.

The young Brora keeper William Counsell making only his second start of the season was called upon to make two important stops in another very accomplished performance.

The victory drew stumps on the season for Brora which will be long remembered for a magnificent Scottish Cup run, although the 6th place finish in the league will be viewed as “should do better” in their end of term report card.
