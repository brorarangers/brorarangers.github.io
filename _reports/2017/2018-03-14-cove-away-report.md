In what was always going to be one of the toughest fixtures of the season, Brora lost by the solitary goal of the game scored minutes from full time.

Cove Rangers top marksman, Mitch Megginson, ensured his team kept their unbeaten League record intact for at least another 3 days, helped in no small manner by Cove keeper Stuart MacKenzie who saved a Scott Graham penalty in the first half.
