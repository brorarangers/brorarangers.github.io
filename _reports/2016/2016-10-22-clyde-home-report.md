Two second half goals from Clyde ended Brora's Scottish Cup dream.

Despite a positive start from the home team, Lady Luck was not smiling on the Brora front line and it took a couple of typically athletic saves from Joe Malin to keep us in the driving seat.

As the first half wore on Clyde began to get a feel for Dudgeon Park and gradually eased themselves into the game.

Clyde opened the scoring on the hour mark from a poorly defended corner and it was always going to be a real battle for the Cattachs from that point. A Flynn header from close range 15 minutes later sealed victory and progression to Round 3 for Clyde.

The Scottish Cup may be over for Brora, but it's back to League business next Saturday as we welcome Clachnacuddin to Dudgeon Park.

We said this would be a good yardstick to measure how a top 3 Highland League side measured up against a top 3 League 2 squad. Now we know, and it certainly isn't all doom and gloom for Brora Rangers.
