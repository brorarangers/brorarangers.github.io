Brora Rangers missed out on the opportunity of making up lost ground at the top of the P&J Highland League after they surrendered a 2 goal advantage at Harlaw Park against Inverurie Loco's.

The Brora line up had both a familiar and an unfamiliar look to it, and it was also debuts for new managers, Ross Tokely for Brora Rangers and Neil Cooper for Inverurie Loco's

Brora had on loan Ross County keeper Ross Munro in goal, deputising for injured Joe Malin and Steven Mackay returned to the side, at left back, in place of suspended Ally MacDonald.

The game started at a frenetic pace with surging attacks from both sides, but Brora quickly gained control of the middle of the park and MacLean and Lisle were stroking the ball around with ease, and feeding Greig and Sutherland both of whom were proving a real handful for the Inverurie back line.

Brora took the lead midway through the first half when Zander Sutherland sent a low curling shot beyond the outstretched arms of Scott Mathieson in the Loco's goal. The goal was not without controversy as the Locos full back Kieran Adams was sure the ball had gone out of play. However Sutherland played to the whistle and made the most of his possible good fortune.

Brora should really have added at least another two before half time as unconverted chances fell to Campbell, Ross and Duff. The Loco's keeper also pulled off at least four outstanding saves to keep the Railwaymen in the game. New Brora keeper Ross Munro was also called into action with a full length save from a well struck Jordan Leyden shot.

The second half commenced as frantic as the first, and kicking down the pronounced slope Loco,s game plan was obvious with up and over football. Brora withstood the Loco's offensive and on 71 minutes doubled their advantage when the unfortunate Daniel Crisp turned the ball into his own net.

What should have been a period of closing the game out, turned into a wretched last 15 minutes, as Inverurie  grabbed a brace of quick goals and pressed very hard for a winner.

Firstly Adams headed home a Leyden free kick and then less than a minute on,Hunter took advantage of a lose ball after Ross Munro was unable to hold a Charlesworth drive.

The last ten minutes saw Loco's on top, but were thwarted by an exceptional save from Munro. At the other end Greig and Sutherland both missed chances to have secured all 3 points for the visitors.
