Brora Rangers ensured there were no slip ups at Mackessack Park when they ran out comfortable winners on Saturday.

Goals from Sutherland, Macdonald, Ross, Brindle and a double from Campbell ensured the 3 points came home with the team for Steven MacDonald's first game as caretaker manager.

The Cattach' s had to rearrange their starting line up as no recognised midfield players were available due to injury, so Steven Ross dropped back into the middle with Jamie Duff playing in front of the back line.

With Orkney based John Pickles recalled to the team, Brora were always going to have plenty of width, and so it proved, with Pickles and Sutherland running riot, down the right and Grieg and MacDonald doing likewise down the left.

With the home side getting as many men behind the ball as possible, the tactics of playing the ball wide was paying dividends with Pickles and Grieg firing in a volley of crosses which tested the home sides back line to the full.

It seemed just a matter of time before the deadlock was broken and it was Zander Sutherland with a 20 yard shot through a body of defenders which opened the scoring after 12 minutes. The visitors were very nearly caught napping when immediately from the start Rothes broke forward and a dipping shot smashed against the top of Joe Malin's crossbar.

However it was not long before Brora reasserted dominance as firstly Craig Campbell and then Ally MacDonald added to the visitors tally. The remainder of the half saw Brora pepper the opposition goal with Pickles, Sutherland, Ross, Duff, MacDonald, Brindle and Greig all nearly making the scoresheet.

The second half was to be a near replay of the first with waves of Brora attacks, desperately defended by a resilient back line of the Rothes defence.

On 54 minutes the scoreboard was moving again as Steven Ross ghosted in at the back post to slide home a cross from the right. Further strikes from Paul Brindle and Cammy racked up the half dozen, which brought down the curtain on a most satisfactory afternoon's work.
