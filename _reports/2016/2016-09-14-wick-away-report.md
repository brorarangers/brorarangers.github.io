Brora Rangers got back to winning ways with two first half goals that proved decisive in a hard fought win in the far north derby played under the floodlights at Wick.

Both teams deserve a lot of credit for serving up entertaining end to end fare on a night of steady drizzle after earlier heavy rain. Despite the weather, the Harmsworth Park pitch held up firm and well with no evidence of cutting up.

The Cattachs made 3 changes from the side held at home by Inverurie 4 days previously. John Pickles started at right back instead of James Ross with Alan Pollock and Andrew Greig coming in for Steven MacKay and Craig Campbell who reverted to the bench.

The best of the early exchanges was a slick Wick move in the 5 th minute with the ball moving swiftly from Danny MacKay to Richard MacAdie and on to Sam MacKay who struck a ferocious rising drive that Joe Malin was grateful to parry over for a corner. In the 9th minute, however, the visitors took the lead with a route one goal that would have been worthy of vintage Wimbledon! Joe Malin hit a high, long clearance from hand that bounced once off the slick surface and on towards the Scorries penalty box. The bounce of the clearance was anticipated by Zander Sutherland whose quick thinking stole a couple of yards on Danny MacKay. He controlled the ball, ran on and from the edge of the box tucked his shot beyond Sean MacCarthy and inside the near post to open the scoring.

The early goal signalled a spell of Brora possession, confidently knocking the ball around, using the full width of the pitch and restricting Wick to attacking on the break. Dale Gillespie hit a powerful 25 yard drive that was turned past for a corner and Zander Sutherland almost got to a long through ball from Martin MacLean just before it reached prostrate Wick keeper MacCarthy’s outstretched arms. The home side were dangerous on the counter-attack and on 18 minutes Sam MacKay’s right wing corner found the head of Steven Anderson at the near post but his effort went just past the post and a few minutes later David Allan ran on to a through ball in the inside right channel and his low, hard cross invited a touch but flew across goal and just past the far post.

These near misses were to prove costly for Wick. Shortly after James Pickles was the first name in the referee’s notebook for a hefty challenge on Ross Tokely in midfield, Brora doubled their lead in spectacular fashion. On 27 minutes, Gavin Morrison’s corner on the left was only partially cleared by the Wick defence. Andrew Greig connected bang on the sweet spot with the ball rolling towards him and hit a screamer into the roof of the net before Sean MacCarthy could move.

The next phase of the game was a period played mainly in midfield. Brora were content to sit on their 2 goal cushion and the Scorries were trying to regain their composure and not concede again. However, 5 minutes from the break the away side went very close to extending their lead. John Pickles picked up a loose ball in the inside right channel and advanced before lashing a 20 yarder just wide of the near post. Pickles next act was to pick up a yellow card as the culmination of a series of minor fouls. Just before half time, Richard MacAdie headed just over following a right wing run and cross by Steven Anderson and Gavin Morrison was booked for catching Sam MacKay’s heel on halfway. So the first half ended with Brora having the bulk of possession and attacking play but Wick showing that they could be very dangerous on the break.

“It’s a game of two halves, Brian” as the old cliché goes and that was true of this match with a role reversal in the second period: Wick had the bulk of possession and attacking play and Brora were dangerous on the break.

Just as Wick almost scored early in the first half, so Brora almost returned the compliment early in the second. A move featuring Ally MacDonald playing to Colin Williamson then back to Zander Sutherland ended with the Cattach striker’s shot being held by Sean MacCarthy.

The home side were gradually turning the screw in their efforts to get back into the game and with the wet surface the players slid around more in the tackle. Alan Pollock saw yellow for a trip on David Allan on halfway and Allan returned the favour by finding his way into the referee’s notebook for a late tackle on Colin Williamson in the Brora half.

Wick brought on Marc MacGregor for Richard MacAdie on the hour mark and there followed a spell of concerted pressure by the Scorries with lots of balls into the box but no clear chances created. Halfway through the second half Sam MacKay went on a dangerous run down the left flank and his cross-shot was held by Joe Malin at the near post. A couple of minutes later, the home side finally breached the Brora rearguard. Wick launched a swift attack down the left side and Gary Manson sent a measured through ball into the danger area that was collected by David Allen who ran on and dinked the ball over the onrushing Joe Malin and low inside the near post.

It was game on now for the final 20 minutes. Brora added fresh legs by bringing on Craig Campbell and Steven MacKay for Andrew Greig and Gavin Morrison. As Wick pressed forward in search of an equaliser they left more gaps at the back that Brora exploited resulting in an exciting ding dong of end to end attacks.

The Cattachs Craig Campbell made a break down the left channel, held off his man and got his shot away which was held by Sean MacCarthy at the near post; then the Scorries David Allan broke and his left wing cross eluded everyone in the crowded box. At the other end, Craig Campbell ran on to a through ball from Steven MacKay but was flagged offside in a very tight decision and then Zander Sutherland smashed an angled volley off the top of the crossbar after being fed by Campbell. 

Then it was Wick’s turn again. 

Sam MacKay went on a mazy right wing run and shot that was held at the near post when it might have been more productive to have crossed.

As the Scorries went for broke, Brora had several counter attack opportunities. Both Zander Sutherland and Craig Campbell had the opportunity to apply the coup de grace 5 minutes from time when both had ample time before Wick got sufficient bodies back to prod home in a goalmouth scramble. Wick came desperately close when full back Michael Steven got his head to a right wing free kick from Gary Manson but Joe Malin held his effort under the crossbar.

In added time, Zander Sutherland was booked for a late challenge on Michael Steven and then Steven was booked for a foul on Sutherland a couple of minutes later. Shades of tit for tat, methinks! Brora brought on James Ross for Alan Pollock in the 5th minute of added time and he was on just long enough to see Brora break and Steven MacKay contrive to shoot wide of an open goal from Craig Campbell’s square pass when it was easier to score in the last meaningful action of an exitcing match that the Cattachs just shaded.
