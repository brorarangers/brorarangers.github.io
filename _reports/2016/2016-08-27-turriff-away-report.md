Brora Rangers headed back north with a comfortable but unspectacular win against a Turriff side who were set up to have an emphasis on defence. 

The 1-0 win for the Cattachs moved them up to 4th in the table as they focus on the task of regaining their Highland League crown. 

Brora started with trialist Ross Tokely at centre half, with Sutherland, Campbell and Brindle up front, and indeed Campbell  could have scored very early on, but his shot was saved by Kevin Main in the Turriff goal.

Joe Malin was called to make his first and only save of the match after 12 minutes from Nowosielski when the Brora defence were caught square, but Malin moved very quickly to close down the danger. 

The first half was goalless, but Brora started the second half, and quickly asserted their dominance. Craig Campbell broke the deadlock in 55 minutes slotting in from close range after some good work on the left from Ally MacDonald. 

Brora very nearly doubled their advantage, when Sutherlands rasping shot was cleared off his own line by James Chalmes, and very shortly thereafter Sutherland had another effort, brilliantly saved down low to his left by Kevin Main.

Main was again called to be at his absolute best when somehow he managed to find a way of keeping Colin Williamson's header out of the net and Turriff still in the game. However Turriff could muster very little up front and Brora left The Haughs with a most valuable 3 points. 

Manager Grant Munro praised his players second half display, whilst acknowledging that the first 45 minutes were dull. 

"We came out for the second half knowing we had to do better and push them back into their own box. We looked very strong at the back so could afford to push our midfielders up the park and this made the difference. We deserved to take the lead when we did and I thought we looked very comfortable thereafter. 1-0 was fine, it could have been 4, but a clean sheet at the back was just as pleasing" said Munro.
