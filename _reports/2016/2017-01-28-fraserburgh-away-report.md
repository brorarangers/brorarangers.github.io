There was no hiding Ross Tokely's frustration after our 2-0 defeat at Bellslea Park on Saturday.

It was the Press and Journal's Big Game for the weekend, but Brora were unable to rise to the occasion against a Fraserburgh side that have a habit of making life difficult for those who aspire to top the League.

The Press and Journal have their match highlights [here](https://goo.gl/08ykJz), and whilst a picture paints a thousand words, we'll have our full match report ready to publish soon.

It's a big weekend coming up in Brora too. Friday night sees us welcome Kenny Clark to ourHall of Fame dinner at Dudgeon Park, with Buckie coming to visit the following afternoon. Plenty to look forward to.
