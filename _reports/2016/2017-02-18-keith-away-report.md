Saturday at Keith saw Brora make enforced changes as Duff and Greig both called off with sickness, and Tokely was forced to rearrange his back line.

Furthermore 5 Brora players were one caution away from a suspension and this weighted heavily on the Managers selection.

Keith started by far the brighter and arguably could have scored twice in the first five minutes as the Cattachs defence struggled to find shape.

However it was just a stay of execution for the Brora goal as Keith took the lead in 21 minutes with an excellent finish by Luke Barbour following good work on the left by James Brownie

Whilst the lead for Keith was no more than they deserved, it was a lead which was to last just seconds as immediately from the kick off Brora's Steven Mackay sent an upfield cross into the Keith box, and Kyle Macleod leapt like a gazelle to head over the advancing Keith keeper.

In 43 minutes Brora took the lead when Stephen Mackay ghosted in on the near post to convert a corner, and sent the Cattachs into the break with a somewhat fortuitous lead.

The half time team talk would have been pointed as the visitors came out for the second half, clearly in a different mind set and very quickly added a third with a great header from Kyle Macleod who latched onto a pin point cross from a corner in 60 minutes

It was Macleod again who added his third and Brora's fourth with another super leap and sealed all three points for Brora.

Brora continued to press and Gillespie was denied by a full length save from Ross Salmon and Campbell and Graham went close too.

Brora boss Tokely paid credit to seventh placed Keith for their first half performance and acknowledged them as the better side in the first period. However he was delighted with the second half reaction and was especially pleased for Kyle Macleod who bagged not just a hat-trick of headers but three difficult chances to further establish himself in the Brora fold.
