Brora Rangers ensured they progressed into the final of the North of Scotland Cup with a win over Forres Mechanics at Dudgeon Park as supporters from both sides enjoyed the sunshine.

A Kyle Macleod hat trick looked to have put the tie out of reach for the Can Cans until Charlie Brown pulled one back for the visitors and Forres enjoyed a short period where they appeared to have the upper hand. However, a 67th minute goal from Steven Mackay ensured Brora Rangers will travel to Mackessack Park to meet Fort William in the final on Saturday 20th May.
