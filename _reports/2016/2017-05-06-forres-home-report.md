Forres were Brora Rangers’ first visitors to Dudgeon Park back in August and they were the last visitors for this season as well as they contested the North of Scotland Cup semi-final.

It was an absolutely glorious day, both to watch and to play football, warm and sunny with barely a cloud in the sky. And Brora’s long-time groundsman Sandy Matheson had the pitch in immaculate condition to provide a surface befitting a semi-final.

The Can-Cans had a few players missing from their squad. To compound the Mosset Park men’s worries, ex-Brora midfielder Alan Pollock pulled a muscle in the warm-up and so they drafted 41 year-old Highland League veteran Charlie Brown from the substitutes bench into their starting line-up.
Brora played a 4-4-2 formation. In front of goalkeeper Joe Malin – back after his injury lay-off – the back four consisted of James Ross and Steven ‘Sid’ MacKay on the flanks with the usual centre-back pairing of Colin Williamson and Jamie Duff. In central midfield were Gavin Morrison and Martin MacLean with Zander Sutherland wide on the right and Andrew Greig on the left flank. Up front, Scott Graham accompanied young Kyle MacLeod.

The opening exchanges had a distinctly ‘end of season’ feel about it with both sides lacking a competitive edge until the home side clicked into gear and took the lead on the quarter hour mark when Kyle MacLeod finished Zander Sutherland’s cross from the left with a powerful near post header. The Cattachs almost doubled their lead a minute later when a powerful low right wing cross from James Ross flew right across the Forres box inviting a finishing touch but evaded the Brora strikers and a couple of minutes after that a similar move and right wing cross saw Ross’s effort sliced over his own crossbar by Can-Can’s defender Graeme Grant.

The home side were well on top now and it was no surprise when they went 2-0 up following a 30-yard left channel run and cross by the dangerous Andrew ‘Chubs’ Greig. Once again, Kyle MacLeod positioned himself on the left-hand side of the box, controlled and deftly finished inside the near post, using placement rather than power to beat Forres keeper Stuart Knight.
Brora were now attacking with free flowing verve using the full width of the pitch and could have gone further ahead several times with several penetrative attacks either missing by a whisker or being blocked by desperate last minute interventions by the hard-pressed Forres rear guard who survived until the interval.

The home side carried on where they had left off in the second half and Kyle MacLeod stabbed a low shot from the edge of the box straight from the restart that was held low at his near post by Stuart Knight. However, the ex-Ross County youngster duly completed his hat-trick with some aplomb, finishing off another Cattachs attack on the left flank by meeting the ensuing cross and heading home from the centre of the six-yard box.

Despite the swagger Brora were now displaying, they were brought back to earth when the Can-Cans pulled back a goal on 55 minutes. A throw on the left just inside the Brora half was quickly crossed diagonally to the right-hand edge of the Brora box where it was controlled by veteran Charlie Brown who clinically tucked it inside Joe Malin’s left hand post.  And the visitors claimed a penalty a couple of minutes later when the impressive Caley Thistle loanee Andrew MacRae went down in the box under challenge from Colin Williamson but referee Alan Proctor waved play on. Another Forres goal at that point might have changed the momentum and set the cattachs amongst the pigeons!

Instead, the Cattachs slowly but surely got back on the front foot and had a sustained spell of really good football to which Forres had little answer. On the hour mark, a goalmouth scramble in the Forres box saw the ball break invitingly to Steven MacKay on the left edge but Sid blazed it high, wide and not so handsome. Shortly after this, Gavin Morrison’s dinked free kick on the left edge near the bye-line was headed just wide of the far post by centre back Jamie Duff when the gap was there to convert.
Brora now brought on John Pickles for James Ross in a like for like substitution and shortly after this Forres had a breakaway in which Stuart Soane headed over from a right-wing corner. Brora then went to the other end and an in-swinging right wing cross from Zander Sutherland was headed goalwards by Steven MacKay but Forres keeper Stuart Knight excelled himself by acrobatically clawing the goal-bound header over the bar.

Brora then took off Zander Sutherland and brought on Craig Campbell to accompany Kyle Sutherland up front with Scott Graham reverting to left midfield and Andrew Greig switching to the right flank and a couple of minutes later the Cattachs sealed the tie by going 4-1 ahead with an excellent if slightly fortuitous goal. Andrew Greig, on the right edge of the box, drove what looked suspiciously like a mishit shot that arrowed straight to Steven MacKay on the opposite flank. Sid buried his low drive to put the tie to bed.

Forres brought on Lewis MacGillivray and replaced Charlie Brown with Connor MacCartney and Brora took off hat-trick man Kyle MacLeod, brought on Paul Brindle for a run out following his long injury lay-off and the match ended with Brora in the attacking ascendancy.

The match was played in a good spirit and the only card was the yellow shown to Andrew MacRae for catching Joe Malin as he cleared his lines. It was accidental, MacRae apologised and that was that.
So Brora will face Fort William in the final on 20th May at MacKessack Park, Rothes after the Lochaber side beat Rothes in the other semi-final. This will be Fort’s first appearance in the final for 23 years and on paper, based on league form, Brora should win the trophy. But trophies aren’t won on paper. Fort are a much improved side and Brora Rangers will have to be at their very best to prevail and become the North of Scotland Cup holders for the third time in the last four years.
