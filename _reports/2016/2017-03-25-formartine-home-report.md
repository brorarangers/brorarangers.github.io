For the second weekend in a row Brora kept a clean sheet while smashing five goals past their opposition.

Hat trick hero, Kyle Macleod had Brora 2-0 ahead within the first five minutes and Formartine were always going to struggle to get themselves back into the game from such an explosive start from the Cattachs.

A 23rd minute goal from Scott Graham, followed by a cheeky lob from Zander on the half hour mark saw Brora head up the tunnel at half time 4-0 ahead.

Kyle claimed his hat trick in the 51st minute, and Formartine were unable to trouble the back four enough to get any shots into Ross Munro in the Brora goal.
