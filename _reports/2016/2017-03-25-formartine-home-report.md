For the second weekend in a row Brora kept a clean sheet while smashing five goals past their opposition.

In doing so we moved back to the top and one point clear at the head of the P&J Highland League after a clinical display of finishing against title chasing Formartine United at Dudgeon Park on Saturday.

Two goals from Kyle MacLeod in the opening six minutes, the second from the penalty spot, gave Brora a dream start. Further goals from Scott Graham and Zander Sutherland put the home side 4-0 up a the break.

MacLeod completed his hat-trick early in the second half as Brora kept their title hopes alive with this win.

Brora went ahead after just two minutes when MacLeod scored with a wonderfully placed header after he got on the end of an Andrew Greig cross.

The home side doubled their lead four minutes later after they were awarded a penalty when Formartine defender Russell McBride fouled MacLeod inside the box. MacLeod took the spot kick  himself and made no mistake from 12 yards.

Brora goalkeeper Ross Munro did well to turn a snap shot from Scott Barbour behind for a corner, but most of the action was at the other end.
MacLeod was presented with a chance to net his hat-trick shortly afterwards but Formartine keeper Andy Reid was quick off his line to make a  point-blank save.

Brora stretched their advantage in the 24th minute when the ever busy Greig squared the ball for Scott Graham who drilled a spectacular 25-yard shot past Reid.

The goals kept coming and it was 4-0 eight minutes later when Sutherland scored from even further out with a stunning shot which flew high into the net.

Formartine made a double substitution at the start of the second half with Scott Ferries and Jamie Masson coming on but Brora went further ahead in the 52nd minute when MacLeod tucked away a Sutherland cut back to claim his second hat-trick since joining Brora in January.

Formartine went in search of a consolation counter and Graeme Rodger was not too far away with a speculative shot from outside the 18-yard box, which cleared the crossbar.

Barbour forced a goal-line clearance from Brora sub John Pickles but that was the extend of Formartine's attack  as messrs, Houston, Mackay,Williamson and Duff were imperious at the back for the Cattachs.

Brora finished strongly as they rang the changes in the last 20 minutes. Sutherland, Graham and Ross should have perhaps turned the goal counter further, but overall it was a very very good day at the office for Brora Rangers.
