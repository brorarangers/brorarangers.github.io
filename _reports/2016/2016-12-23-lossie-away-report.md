Brora's ambition of regaining the P&J Highland League was near blown away with a hapless second half performance which left the hardy band of travelling supporters bewildered.

On a cold windy night in Lossiemouth, the Cattachs started brightly with Sutherland, Greig, Gillespie, Campbell and Ross all peppering the home goal, and the Lossiemouth goalkeeper was certainly having his hands kept warm.

Greig on the left wing was electric and unplayable and was brought down almost continually and it was from one such resulting free kick that Craig Campbell opened the scoring with a well placed header. All looked under control and a most satisfactory opening 15 minutes.

Lossiemouth were level within 5 minutes when an immobile Joe Malin spilt a shot and the Lossiemouth striker was first to the ball to equalise.

The remainder of the first half was an ill tempered affair with Brora maintaining the upper hand without ever looking as if they were going to extend their lead.

The second half started with Lossiemouth really up for the contest whilst Brora seemed to tier very quickly being a yard slower to every ball and lacking appetite.

Ally MacDonald conceded a needless penalty and received his marching orders and Lossiemouth converted the spot kick.

Brora's discipline fell to pieces as did their shape and Lossiemouth dominated the remainder of the game, scoring twice more whilst Brora were left with just the odd half chance.
