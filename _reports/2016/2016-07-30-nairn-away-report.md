Brora overcame Nairn County in a professional manner, in the opening game of the P&J Highland League, at Station Park Nairn on Saturday.

Facing a new look, reconstituted Nairn side, this could have been a banana skin, but the Cattachs prevailed in a competitive game and ran out very comfortable 4-0 winners, to take home the first three points of the season.

Nairn’s difficulties have been well documented and it was great to see that the worthy folk of the town had turned out to cheer them on. The ground and the pitch were in excellent order and it was welcoming to get the new season underway.

Brora were kitted out in their rapier like new black kit, with new club sponsor’s Rae Energy’s logo embroidered to the fore.

The Cattachs started exactly how they would have wanted, when after just 2 minutes top marksman Steven Mackay rose to head home an Andrew Grieg cross. This was the worst possible start for the inexperienced Nairn side but to their credit they very quickly regrouped, and whilst it was a matter of “manning the pumps” for their defenders they were effective as they kept Brora at bay.

Both Sutherland ( volley) and Greig ( curling shot) went desperately close, and the latter effort was exceptionally well saved by the young Nairn keeper Maclean. On 42 minutes Mackay thought that he had doubled Brora’s advantage but saw his header cannon back off the crossbar and Sutherland was equally unfortunate when his direct strike was again wonderfully saved by Maclean.

As the half time whistle blew, both sides could take positives away from the 45 minutes. Brora fully controlled proceedings and had the lead, whilst Nairn had survived the early storm and were certainly still in the game.

The second period started in similar form, with Mackay, Pollock and Greig all having half chances. On the hour, the ever dangerous Zander Sutherland made it 2-0 after he picked up on a Dale Gillespie cross field ball, to poke past the advancing Nairn keeper. Steven Mackay should have scored again shortly after but Nairn man of the match, Maclean again pulled off a cracking stop.

Nairn did not let their heads drop, and whilst Malin in the Brora goal had little to do, he dealt with what came his way in his normally competent manner.

Brora continued to play long balls up and across the field and this troubled the Nairn defence, but the experienced Paul Macleod controlled the back line well, and continued to frustrate the Brora forwards.

With 10 minutes remaining James Ross made it 3-0 Brora with a calm finish and with just 4 minutes of regulation time on the clock, substitute Paul Brindle made it 4-0 to complete the match.

Brora, Assistant Manager Steven Biscuits MacDonald was delighted to come away with all 3 points. “ We started in the most positive of manners and our early goal was just what we needed. Nairn were here to defend and you can’t blame them for that, and what they did, they did very well. They have been through turbulent times and all credit to all their players, for going out and playing for the jersey. However our second half performance was much better as all the players stepped up a gear, and I know there is so much more to come from this very exciting squad”
