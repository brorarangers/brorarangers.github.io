Brora Rangers racked up their 7th League victory in a row to keep the pressure on at the top of the table with a 2-0 win over Huntly at Dudgeon Park on Saturday.

Goals from Andrew Greig and Kyle Macleod see Brora, Buckie and Cove heading into Wednesday evenings games all sitting on 75 points.

Scott Houston, Scott Graham, Martin Maclean, Steven Mackay and keeper Joe Malin all returned to the starting line up.

It was a fine afternoon for football, made all the better with the opportunity to retire to the Social Club at full time for our Player of the Year awards for this season.
