Brora Rangers secured their third North of Scotland in 4 years with a 4-1 win for which, although the score line was emphatic in the end, they were made to fight by a youthful Fort William side.

This was only Fort’s second appearance in the final and their first for 23 years and manager Ally Ewan’s last in charge of the Lochaber side before taking over the reins at Lossiemouth next season.

There has been a lot of debate about switching the competition to the end of the season and one of the consequences of this was the difficulty in securing a centrally located neutral venue to host the final. Grant Street would be the obvious choice but Clach’s ground was unavailable. In the end, the losing semi-finalists against the Fort – Rothes – hosted the final and a truly excellent job they made of it. This was the first time ever that the club had hosted a major final at MacKessack Park. Nothing was too much trouble and as a result of this, they rightly earned plaudits from the players, officials and fans of both the finalists.

After the recent spell of fine weather across the Highlands, Cup Final day was a real contrast, cold, wet and miserable, but both teams served up a fine match that was a credit to the competition. Brora’s player manager Ross Tokely was absent in Portugal so assistant John Docherty was in charge for the match. Another absentee was young Orcadian full back John Pickles who was attending his brother’s stag do so the Cattachs’ starting line-up saw James Ross and Steven ‘Sid’ MacKay on either side of centre backs Colin Williamson and Jamie Duff with a midfield four of Zander Sutherland on the right, Gavin Morrison and Martin ‘Digger’ MacLean taking the central positions with Andrew ’Chubs’ Greig on the left flank.

The match started with Brora on the front foot with the young Fort side looking a little overawed by the occasion. The opening exchanges were played in the Fort William half with Brora knocking the ball about confidently and using the full width of the pitch so that both wingers saw a lot of the ball. And the favourites duly went ahead in the 9th minute with what was, in truth, rather a soft goal. After a series of Brora attacks, Gavin Morrison’s in-swinging corner from the left headed straight for goal and Fort goalkeeper Stephen Foster elected to punch clear. Perhaps the driving rain unsighted the young Caledonian Thistle loanee but he only succeeded in helping the ball into his own net, although Morrison’s corner was goal-bound in any case and so he was credited with the opening goal.

If the opening goal dented keeper Foster’s confidence, it may have been restored shortly afterwards when he held a strong downward Colin Williamson header on the line after Williamson connected with another left wing free-kick delivered by Gavin Morrison and went on to have an excellent match. He saved even more impressively when, following good work on the right flank between Zander Sutherland and James Ross, the overlapping full back’s hard cross was met on the volley by the inrushing Martin MacLean and Foster did extremely well to parry away MacLean’s goal-bound effort.

It was all one-way traffic at this stage. Another near thing was an acrobatic overhead kick from hitman Kyle MacLeod whose effort after Sid’s left-sided diagonal cross to the far post was headed back into his path just cleared the crossbar and shortly before half time Scott Graham headed a pinpoint right wing cross wide of the far post with the goal at his mercy. So, Fort William could consider themselves fortunate to reach the interval only one goal down when the Cattachs could have been out of sight on another day.

What a different story the second half turned out to be. Whatever was said to the Lochaber men at half time they clearly came out in the second half determined to make more of a contest and were clearly in the ascendancy in the first quarter of an hour of the second period. A right-wing corner was headed downwards and goal-wards by Fort centre-back Farquhar MacRae. Luckily, Brora had stationed a man on each post for the corner and James Ross gratefully hacked clear.  On the hour mark however, Fort William were on level terms. A Brora clearance was picked up in midfield by centre back Alasdair Stark – another Caley Thistle loanee – and he played a through ball over the top to the right edge of the Cattachs’ penalty area where  dangerman Scott Davidson latched on to it and coolly lobbed it over Joe Malin as the keeper rushed out to challenge. A route one goal to be sure but played with accuracy and placement and finished with a high degree of skill. The goal was Davidson’s 30th of the campaign, a truly astonishing scoring record considering he played the whole season for a team that finished second bottom of the Highland League.

The equaliser certainly put the Lochaber men’s tails up and you could see the confidence surging through their players and at this point Brora brought on Craig Campbell for Andrew Greig in an attempt to wrest back the initiative and his introduction almost paid early dividends when he combined well on the right with James Ross whose cross was headed downwards by Martin MacLean only to be clawed away by the diving Stephen Foster. In the 74th minute, Brora’s next substitution did pay instant dividends when Steven Ross – brought on for Kyle MacLeod – scored with his second touch and within a minute of coming on. His first touch in the right channel was to switch play to the left where Martin MacLean combined with Zander Sutherland and following Digger’s diagonal cross he found the net with his second touch, a flicked header at the far post.

This was a killer blow for Fort William. Just as their equaliser on the hour put wind in their sails, this goal 15 minutes later had them becalmed in the doldrums. And on 86 minutes their fate was sealed with another Steven Ross goal fairly similar to the decisive second. This time he met Gavin Morrison’s left wing corner with another header inside the far post. In the 90th minute, Brora rubbed salt in Fort’s wounds by completing the scoring with a 4th goal. Another left-wing corner from Gavin Morrison was headed to the far post by Sid and blocked on the line by the keeper. But Colin Williamson was following up and scrambled the ball over the line to give the score-line an emphatic look.

Brora have a very short close season compared with other sides but since Ross Tokely and John Docherty took over the reins in January, they seem to have ironed out a lot of the unexpected dropped points. They have finished the season strongly and only missed out on the league title by a point having clawed back Buckie’s big lead when the pair took over. So, if they can continue next season as they have finished off this one they must be serious contenders for more silverware to come.
