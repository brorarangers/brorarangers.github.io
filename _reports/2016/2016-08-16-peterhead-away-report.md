It will have been a long journey back to Sutherland on Tuesday evening for the Brora players, after they let slip a 2-0 advantage against the SPFL League 1 outfit Peterhead. 

Against the overall run of play, Brora were the better side and deserved to progress into the draw for the 3rd round of the Irn-Bru Cup, a fact duly acknowledged by the Peterhead management after the game. However 5 minutes of carelessness and loss of concentration saw defeat grasped from the jaws of victory as Peterhead finished well the three opportunities which were gifted to them. 

In front of a crowd of near 400 the Blue Toon started the brighter and Joe Malin needed to be at his best to save a close range effort from Brown. However that early scare seem to galvanise Brora into action and they comfortably dominated the the remainder of the half. 

Brora arrive at Peterhead determined to take the game to the hosts and Greig, Sutherland and Brindle up front gave the home defenders a torrid time. Sutherland playing more in the middle seemed most effective and he and Greig had a highly productive first 45 minutes. 

It was this combination that opened the scoring for Brora. Greig latching onto a pass from Morrison rounded his marker with consummate ease and delivered a perfect pass to the speedy Sutherland who cleverly rounded the advancing keeper and flicked the ball into the net from an acute angle. The lead was no more than Brora deserved and they continued to strengthen their grip on the game, with Pollock, Morrison and Gillespie controlling events in the middle of the park. 

Brora very nearly made it 2-0 as Brindle who was looking sharp and agile fired a well struck effort goal bound, but Hobday was equal to it. 

The home team were booed off the park at half time, as the home supporters expressed their displeasure with their teams performance. 

Brora emerged from the break in exactly the same frame of mind as before and it was only two minutes before striker Paul Brindle doubled the teams advantage. A long kick from Joe Malin was flicked over the head of the Peterhead back line and Brindle using his pace raced clear before finishing with aplomb as he lobbed the Peterhead keeper. 

Brora continued to press forward and Peterhead were restricted to long range efforts and speculative crosses. Both Sutherland, Greig and Brindle all had half chances but their efforts were blocked by some last ditch Peterhead defending. 

After 10 minutes of the second period, Peterhead made a double substitution and whilst McAllistair and Reilly strengthened their attack, Brora did not look to be in any imminent difficulty. 

With a place in the third round looking likely disaster struck in the space of less than 6 minutes as some indifferent defending and schoolboy errors let Peterhead in for a quick fire treble. 

Sloppy defending let Brown head home to pull one back and McAllister levelled the score, after Pollock gave the ball away on the wing. The Peterhead winner followed almost immediately as the Brora defence misjudged a Peterhead clearance and McIntosh ran onto the ball to complete a recovery that never looked likely just 5 minutes earlier.
