Cove Rangers returned south with 3 very valuable points after beating Brora Rangers 2-1 in the top of the table clash at Dudgeon Park.

Brora were without the midfield duo of Morrison and Maclean both of whom had not recovered from leg injuries.

Both Brora and Cove signalled their intent to attach as the win would certainly give the victors a big advantage as the league heads into its festive fixtures.

After some half chances at either end , it was Cove who broke the deadlock when Meggison converted the penalty after Williamson was adjudged to have offended in the box. It looked a harsh decision, but Cove took full advantage  as they bossed the remainder of the half, with Meggison adding  a second when Malin and the Brora defence failed to deal with a regulation cross and an open net presented itself to the Cove marksman.

The second half was a much more evenly fought competition, with replacement striker Craig Campbell adding potency to the Brora front line , and it was he who pulled a goal back with a beautifully taken finish after he slipped Watson with his turn of foot.

Despite pushing hard Brora could not recover the position. Several efforts just went wide with the Cove keeper well beaten and Ally MacDonalds free kick coming back off the inside of the post to deny the Cattachs a point.
