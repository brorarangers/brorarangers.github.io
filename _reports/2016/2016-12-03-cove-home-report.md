Brora lost at home to Cove in this top of the table clash that may have a crucial bearing on the destination of the Highland League title this season. Even although the league programme is only halfway through, this match could certainly be considered a 6-pointer

Cove boss John Sherin was understandably satisfied with the outcome. “I thought this was a hard-fought game – pretty close - between two good teams and we just managed to hold out in the end. At the start of the second half we had a fair few chances to put the game to bed. They pulled a goal back but I thought we were fairly comfortable for the last 10 minutes. It’s the first time we’ve got a win here in Brora for 5 years so that is good.

This is an important 3 points but it is still just 3 points. Brora, Formartine and Buckie are also still in the hunt so it’s very much game on. The 3 points takes us a bit closer to Brora and to Buckie, too.
We played 18 games in 9 weeks and had many consecutive Wednesday nights and that was affecting our form. We were running out of bodies and were running on empty. We’ve got a difficult month ahead but now we’re running into Saturdays only, our form is settling.”

Brora player-manager Grant Munro was frustrated and disappointed. “Cove deserved it. I prepared the boys for it but from my point of view that wasn’t good enough. The boys on the park are just not performing and that’s another example of the form of the last 2 weeks, the draw against Nairn and last week we scraped a 4-3 against Strathspey.

You hope the boys will turn up like they did against Formartine earlier this season but sadly no, so you’re waiting for the first goal to go in. It was a penalty but no complaints there and the way we laid down after that was very disappointing. The in and out form is totally frustrating but to be honest we haven’t been good enough and team-wise we have been a bit short all season and that shows in the league table. This game wasn’t definitive but we’ve got a mountain to climb and now it’s very steep.”  

With Martin MacLean and Morrison both out injured, Brora’s midfield had an unfamiliar look and Cove were gaining the ascendency in midfield with the incisive play of Mitch Megginson and Blair Yule in particular causing real concern to the home rearguard. However, the Cattachs were first to threaten with Zander Sutherland’s 4th minute free kick in the inside right channel being cleared to Andrew Greig on the left whose second ball in to the box was scrambled clear.

After 15 minutes Cove came close after a mistake by Scott Lisle saw the ball break to danger man Mitch Megginson and his fierce shot was parried by home keeper Joe Malin. However, Brora’s reprieve was short lived as in the 21st minute Zander Sutherland, helping out in his own box was adjudged to have committed a foul in attempting to clear and referee Dan MacFarlane pointed to the spot. Mitch Megginson duly converted the penalty into the roof of the net to put the champions ahead.

Brora attempted to retaliate and 3 minutes after going behind, Steven Ross had a great chance to restore parity following a pinpoint left wing cross from Andrew Greig but his free header was held on the line by Cove keeper Stuart MacKenzie. The Cattachs stuttered in midfield and seemed hesitant and uncertain in defence. Blair Yule almost doubled the lead following a slip by Jamie Duff allowed him a clear run to the left edge of the Brora box but his rasping drive was blocked.

On 34 minutes Cove doubled their lead. A fast raid on the left resulted on a long cross into the box breaking to that man Megginson who controlled the ball and shot home unerringly. Brora had no cutting edge and their only riposte was a near post shot on the left edge from Steven Ross that was comfortably held by the keeper. On the other hand, Cove’s incisive attacks carried real menace and both Jonny Smith and Mitch Megginson saw efforts scrambled clear before the half time whistle brought some welcome relief to home side.

In a declaration of attacking intent, Brora made a double substitution at half time with Craig Campbell and Paul Brindle replacing Dale Gillespie and Scott Lisle and initially the Cattachs looked more threatening in their efforts to pull back an early goal. Defender Ross Tokeley’s flicked header from Andrew Greig’s left wing corner just missed the far post. But just like the start of the first half, Brora’s early second half impetus soon died away and Cove were often first to the second ball and seemed the more likely to score. On 51 minutes, the ever-threatening Mitch Megginson unleashed a fierce 8 yard shot just past the near post and then Harry Milne went close with a free header at the far post following a left-wing corner.

Brora finally gave themselves hope just past the hour mark when Craig Campbell ran on to a through ball from Alan Pollock and tucked it just inside Stuart MacKenzie’s left hand post to halve the deficit. The goal lifted the home side and following a great run and pass on the right by Zander Sutherland, Steven Ross’s scissors kick flew just beyond the far post and Ally MacDonald sliced a shot just wide of the near post following further good wing play on the right by Zander Sutherland.

At this late stage in the game Cove were concentrating on running down the clock and holding on to their lead. 3 minutes from full time, Brora had one more real chance to rescue something from the game with a 20 yard free kick just outside the D. Ally MacDonald’s strike cannoned off the left-hand post and away to safety with Cove keeper Stuart MacKenzie beaten all ends up.

In a way, the free kick near miss summed up Brora’s day with the run of the ball and the fluidity not being quite there. However, there is no question but that Cove were worthy of their win and it sends an ominous message to the other Highland League title contenders.
