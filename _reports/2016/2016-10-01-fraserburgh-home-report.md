In a contrast to the rain of last weekend it was difficult to believe it was the first day of October as the sun bathed Dudgeon Park on Saturday afternoon.

For Fraserburgh fans, it was probably equally difficult to believe that they weren't celebrating a lead within the opening minutes of a well contested game.

With Colin Williamson and Ross Tokely both unavailable this weekend, Grant Munro included himself and Dale Gillespie in what felt, initially, like a makeshift defence and it took some determined work and a couple of inspired saves from Joe Malin to keep the ball out of the home net.

The Broch defensive line had organisational and communication problems of their own though, and Zander Sutherland was quick to capitalise in the 7th minute sliding the ball under the Fraserburgh keeper.

Seven minutes later, in what was a very even and fadt paced game, it was Zander again who got his head on the end of a cross from Andrew Greig to make it 2-0.

This early 2 goal cushion settled the Brora squad, and by the end of the first half the Cattachs had the game by the scruff of the neck and a frustrated Fraserburgh were harried into a succession of high balls lumped forward and giving away clumsy free kicks.

Whilst there were no further goals in the second half, we are more than happy to head to Buckie with the 3 points with an opportunity to get back on level terms points wise with the current League leaders.
