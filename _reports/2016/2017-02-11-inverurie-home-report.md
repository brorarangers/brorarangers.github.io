Brora Rangers claimed a quarter final spot in the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup in a commanding fashion on Saturday.

A first 45 minutes produced some battling football from both sides, with the Cattachs making the most of their chances and heading for the half time team talk leading 2-0.

The second half, however, saw Brora turn the screw as they constantly kept the Locos back line under pressure.
