Brora Rangers led Inverurie Locos a merry dance as they swept the Harlaw Park men aside scoring eight times without reply in their defence of the Highland League Cup.

The Cattachs brought tough tackling Caley Thistle loanee Blair MacLennan into midfield for the rested Dale Gillespie and also welcomed back Steven ‘Sid’ Mackay into the starting line-up playing in a fluid 4-4-2 system. The pitch was heavy and cut up fairly easily, particularly in the school end goalmouth. The goals were certainly shared around with seven different Brora men getting on the scoresheet.

The home side got off to a flyer in the 3rd minute when Zander Sutherland opened the scoring with a scrappy goal that barely had the legs to reach the back of the net. What was hugely more important than the manner of the goal was that it was his 100th goal for Brora Rangers - a magnificent feat.

After Sutherland’s opener, the match settled down into a fairly evenly matched contest with both sides looking to push men forward at every opportunity although Brora looked the more dangerous in front of goal. Just as it looked as if the sides would go into the break with just the one goal between them, the Locos gave away possession on the right edge of the box. Scott Graham picked up the loose ball and hit an absolute beauty of a volley that dipped just under the crossbar into the opposite corner of the net. There was just time to kick off before the half time whistle blew.

Inverurie started the second half brightly as they sought to pull back the early goal that would have got them back in the match. Instead, however, the 3rd goal came the Cattachs way five minutes after the break. Scott Graham, who had an excellent game on the right of the pitch, tenacious and full of running, played in Steven Mackay who was one on one with Locos keeper Scott Mathieson but from a narrow angle. Morrison parried Sid’s shot but Graham was there to scramble the loose ball home.

After this decisive third goal Brora began to dominate the match and looked likely to score with every attack whilst Inverurie seemed to throw in the towel. The home side went for an even more attacking option on 56 minutes by bringing on Steven Ross for midfielder Blair MacLennan who has an impressive home debut snapping at the heels of the Locos as they sought to build up attacks. Six minutes later Brora brought on Craig Campbell for young Kyle MacLeod to add a different attacking dimension as ‘Cammy’ is adept at hold up play to allow other players to arrive in the box as well as being a good finisher on his own account. Ross Tokely then quickly made his final change bringing on Andrew Greig for Zander Sutherland in a straight swap as ‘Chubbs’ usually a left winger played in Sutherland’s position wide on the right.

Craig Campbell had a couple of near misses. Firstly, after good work on the left, he fed Steven Ross whose shot was blocked and Campbell lifted the loose ball over the top and very shortly after that Campbell shot from the left edge of the box and his low effort just shaved the far post. But another goal was coming and on 72 minutes a lovely sweeping left to right move by Brora started by Steven Mackay who headed on to Craig Campbell who swiftly moved the ball on to Andrew Greig to sweep home for number 4.

Just a couple of minutes later Brora routed the Inverurie defence again with another sweeping move that was virtually the reverse of the previous goal. This time it was a right to left move with Greig turning provider this time by feeding Campbell once again who again moved the ball on to Steven Ross for the Cattachs to go nap.

It took just a couple of more for goal number 6 to arrive. This time Steven Mackay headed home at the far post after a left-wing cross from Scott Graham who popped up on the opposite flank on this occasion.

Brora’s flowing, attacking football certainly induced desperate clearances by the overworked Inverurie defence and one clearance by Ross Anderson gave the opportunity for fans to witness a rarely seen sight. Not only did his full-blooded clearance sail over the perimeter fence of Dudgeon Park, it also comfortably cleared the back garden and roof of the adjoining house in Seaforth Road!

9 minutes from the end Brora bagged the magnificent 7, Colin Williamson getting in on the scoring act. A goal bound free- kick on the left edge of the box by Scott Graham was punched over the bar by Locos keeper Scott Mathieson. From the resulting left wing corner, Williamson headed in at the far post.

Brora continued to make chances at will against the now demoralised visitors. The best 2 of the chances fell to Steven Mackay from deliveries by the respective full backs and on each occasion MacKay’s efforts were deflected inches wide. Firstly, from Ally MacDonald’s right-sided free kick, Mackay’s header was deflected past the far post and minutes later in added time Scott Houston’s cross from the right was met by Mackay and the deflection carried the ball just outside the near post for a corner. But the home side were not to be denied and, from the resulting corner, Scott Houston headed in his first ever goal for Brora Rangers to delighted cheers.

Whilst one can understand Locos manager Neil Cooper when he says there was never an 8-goal margin between the sides, that is only true of the first half of the game and they did seem to capitulate in a surprisingly easy way under the Brora onslaught in the second half. In that sense, Ross Tokely is right when he says that after they got the third goal Brora could have reached double figures.

This was another pleasing and encouraging performance from Brora Rangers. Since he has taken over as manager, Ross seems to have recaptured that elusive but essential ingredient for a successful team – their spirit. This feeds into other areas within the team – they work as a unit, meaning the old fluidity is returning, the gaps between the defence and midfield have gone and they are working more closely - literally and metaphorically. The blend of youth and experience is working. The feel-good factor is back. It’s a good time to be supporting the Cattachs.
