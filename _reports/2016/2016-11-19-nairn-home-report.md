For 70 minutes Brora Rangers were comprehensively out played, out thought and out muscled, but in the end analysis, should have won this game given the opportunities they squandered in the last 20 minutes.

Nairn County went in at the break as deserved 2-1 leaders, having been 2-0 up, before Brindle pulled one back for the home side.

Nairn emerged from the break and immediately went onto the offensive, and pinned Brora back into their own half. They were awarded a somewhat fortuitous penalty which was converted with aplomb.

At 3-1 to the good, Nairn continued to press forward as Brora struggled to find any form. With the clock running down Campbell and Scott Lisle came on and transformed the dynamic of the play.

The last 20 minutes saw Brora control the game with Pickles and Sutherland linking well down the right flank and their crosses causing havoc in the Nairn defence. Two of these crosses were converted by Craig Campbell as the Cattachs came roaring back.

Scott Lisle was putting his foot on the ball and his telling distribution allowed Greig and Sutherland to run onto the ball behind their marker.

From the battery of crosses Steven Ross, normally so clinical, sent header after header wide or over the bar. He was unlucky when after a brilliant piece of individual skill his shot came off the bar, and then post before being cleared off the goal line.

Two points dropped or one gained? - Only time will tell, but this wasn't the outcome we were hoping for.
