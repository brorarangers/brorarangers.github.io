Brora Rangers bounced back against Keith on Saturday to seal 3 points, 6 goals and a clean sheet.

Whilst Sunday's Scottish sports media will no doubt be awash with the post match analysis of the performance of our National squad after a tense 1-1 draw at Hampden against Lithuania, we suspect little of it will be as upbeat as our view of the response of the Brora squad at Dudgeon Park.

A hat-trick from Steven Ross, further goals from Alan Pollock, Colin Williamson and Zander Sutherland; a starting League debut for a hugely impressive Scott Lisle and a run out for his brother Cameron; a clean sheet for Joe.

All in all, a satisfying afternoon at Dudgeon Park for the home team, and exactly the response we were looking for. 

Bouncebackability - it's in the Oxford English Dictionary. It's in the DNA of winners. It's in the Dudgeon Park dressing room.
