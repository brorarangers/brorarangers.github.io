Brora Rangers progressed through to the 2nd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup, after a 4-1 victory away at a rain lashed Claggan Park, Fort William. 

The elements conspired against flowing football, and much credit much be given to the ground staff who were out working the water collection machines from 7am to ensure that the match went ahead. 

The high wind and relentless driving rain made playing conditions difficult and Fort William adapted to the elements far better than Brora. 

Brora started the brighter and an early strike from Mackay was brilliantly parried around the post by the Fort William keeper. After 10 minutes Mackay nearly opened the scoring but again the keeper earned his corn with another great stop. 

The Brora defence were coming under a good deal of pressure and often getting caught in possession as the ball was difficult to control on the ground. After 25 minutes another defensive error let Fort drive  towards the Brora goal and Colin Williamson was called to clear off the line to prevent the hosts taking a deserved lead. 

However Fort William were not to be denied when a ball over the Brora defence left the Cattachs back line very square and the resultant scramble in the box saw Highet poke home from close range. 

Fort William very nearly doubled their lead within the next minute, but Joe Malin made a wonderful stretched save to keep Brora in the match. 

Brora's remaining first half efforts were restricted to over hit crosses and wayward shots, and the Fort William keeper was not really troubled. 

The second half saw Brora come out with a far greater focus and application and they immediately put Fort William under pressure. However their keeper was up to the task and at the other end Joe Malin made another wonderful save to deny ex Cattach Colin Maclean. 

On 57 minutes it took a touch of magic from Zander Sutherland to level proceedings. Picking up a ball wide on the left, Zander cut in, beating his marker and unleashed a wonderful strike which the keeper could only push onto the underside of the bar with the ball then bouncing into the net. 

Within 5 minutes the visitors were ahead when substitute Craig Campbell added a second as Brora gradually took control of the match. Fellow substitute Steven Ross made it 3-1 with a well placed header, before Craig Campbell added his second and Brora's 4th. 

Brora returned north safe in the knowledge that they are in the hat for the second round draw, and whilst their victory was in the end comfortable, the overall performance left a few question marks and a report card of "must do better".
