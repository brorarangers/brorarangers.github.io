Ross Tokely will look back upon his first match in charge at Dudgeon Park with a good degree of satisfaction, but aware there are still areas to be worked upon.

"I was delighted in the manner which we started the match and we produced some great flowing moves and converted our early chances well. We could quite easily have added a few more in the first half but a combination of good goalkeeping and bad luck saw us miss out."

"What was disappointing was losing two goals at the end of the half, when we seemed to lose concentration. We will need to work on this during the week. I was pleased how we quickly regained dominance in the second half, and really should have converted a few more of the chances we created but Grant Pennet played really well in goal for Vale"

On a lovely winters afternoon Brora started in a dominant fashion and had new signing from Ross County up front, supported by Steven Ross.

Brora opened the scoring in 10 minutes, but it was the unfortunate Steven Davidson who directed the ball past his wrong footed goalkeeper. Within 8 minutes Brora were 2 up when returnee Scott Graham rose well to connect with a deep cross to head the Cattachs further ahead.

The Vale were now under considerable pressure and new signing Kyle Macleod quickly announced his arrival with a well taken goal after some good work by Steven Ross.

As the pressure continued from the home side, a  great through ball from Jamie Duff sent Steven Ross through behind Scott Begg. The Vale defender was a yard slower than the Brora forward, and a lunging challenge took Ross down from behind. To the astonishment of the crowd no penalty was awarded and the visitors could count themselves lucky.

Brora further extended their lead to 4 when "Man of the Match" Andrew Greig swept the ball past Pennet after a searching run.

As the watch ran down towards half time, Deveronvale gave themselves a life line in 44 minutes when Scott Begg headed home after he picked up on a deflected header from Dane Ballard.

There were shades of the Loco's game when within a minute Vale had added another with Ballard slotting home following a mistake by Brora, who needlessly gave away procession in midfield.

Clearly Tokely had a few words during the break, and Brora restarted the game in a much more focused manner, quickly closing down the midfield and restricting the visitors to breakaway attacks.

Brora extended their lead on 55 minutes when Steven Ross rose above his marker to head home and then Kyle Macleod converted a penalty to chalk up the half dozen.

Brora continued to press and Scott Lyle was unlucky when his goalbound shot was blocked by Liam Forbes and  Pennet made a series of full length saves to deny Brora further goals.
