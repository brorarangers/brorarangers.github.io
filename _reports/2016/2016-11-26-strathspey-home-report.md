Brora Rangers finished November with the 3 points required against Strathspey Thistle, but it is likely that Strathspey Thistle headed home the happier side.

Brora started brightly with a goal within 8 minutes for Zander. Spirited defending from Strathspey, along with the woodwork kept the dominant home side at bay, but a breakaway goal from the Strathspey Jags in the 24th minute shocked the home support.

Further goals from Martin, Chubbs and Paul Brindle kept Brora in the lead, but a double from the ever dangerous Inaki Fernandino-Soto made for a nail-biting game for all present.
