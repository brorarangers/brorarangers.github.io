Brora Rangers overcame dogged resistance from Strathspey Thistle to take the 3 points but it was a close-run thing in the end.

This win moves Brora back to the top of the Highland League with Buckie on Scottish Cup duty. Joe Malin failed to overcome a knee injury he suffered last week so Daniel Cormack made a rare appearance between the sticks for the Cattachs whilst Ross Tokely returned to the side after a stint working abroad and Scott Lisle started with Alan Pollock reverting to the bench.

Brora reverted to a back four after flirting with a 3-5-2 in previous matches and it seemed as if normal service had been resumed when Zander Sutherland opened the scoring in the 9th minute taking a crossfield pass on the right and rounding the Grantown Jags keeper Michael MacCallum to tuck into the net from the 6-yard line and on the quarter hour Colin Williamson headed against the far junction of post and bar from a left-wing corner.

Strathspey then had a swift break when James Fraser fed Inaki Fernandino-Soto and his dangerous cross was headed clear by Colin Williamson. That was a portent of things to come and on 25 minutes Strathspey equalised following another counter-attack on the right. James Fraser’s tried to lob home keeper Daniel Cormack who got his fingers to it to push it to the left where Sean O’Donnell arrived to bundle the loose ball home at the far post from a yard out.

Five minutes after the equaliser the home side took the lead again when a Ross Tokely cross from the right was met by Martin MacLean who headed home from the penalty spot. The remaining 15 minutes of the first half was played mainly in midfield with Brora doing the bulk of the attacking but without causing too much danger to Strathspey’s defence. The closest the Cattachs came to increasing their lead was a sweeping move 5 minutes before the break when Craig Campbell fed Andrew Greig on the left and Scott Lisle was only inches away from connecting with his cross at the far post.

Brora dominated the first 15 minutes of the second half with Zander Sutherland to the fore in their best attacking moves. 3 minutes after the break he went on a brilliant weaving run into the box and his shot deflected wide off Jags keeper Michael MacCallum’s knee. A couple of minutes later his beautiful curling free kick from the right just needed a touch on the 6-yard line. Then it was full-back Ally MacDonald’s turn to blaze high, wide and not very handsome from the left edge of the box after Dale Gillespie’s cut-back played him in. Zander Sutherland then threatened again with another incisive run on the right and his cut-back from the bye-line was gratefully hooked clear by a Strathspey boot.

Such profligacy in failing to convert any of the series of chances that the Cattachs carved out often causes unease that a breakaway from the team under the cosh could leave the team with the attacking momentum under-manned and vulnerable at the other end and so it proved on the hour. Inaki Fernandino-Soto was able to run to the left edge of the Brora box where he cut inside his man to curl a beautiful right-footed shot inside the far post for Strathspey’s second equaliser.

Brora responded to this setback by replacing midfielder Martin MacLean with attacker Paul Brindle and very shortly afterwards they took the lead for the third time albeit in controversial circumstances. Andrew Greig took a free kick out on the left and the ball went all the way through the crowded penalty box and straight into the far corner of the net without any player touching it. The linesman flagged for offside against Paul Brindle who was standing a couple of yards out in an offside position at the near post. However, referee Graham Fraser allowed the goal to stand on the basis that Brindle had not touched the ball and was

deemed not to have been interfering with play. That was at least contentious as it could be argued that Brindle must have been in keeper MacCallum’s line of vision at the near post as the free kick came into the goalmouth. The ‘not interfering with play’ interpretation has caused many an argument in all leagues since the new rules came into force but Brora weren’t arguing!

The Cattachs replaced Ross Tokely with the fresh legs of James Ross on 68 minutes shortly followed by Gavin Morrison for young Scott Lisle to try and protect their lead which seemed somewhat precarious as Strathspey clearly felt aggrieved and for a good 20-minute spell after the goal raised their work rate and determination, taking the game to Brora. Twice Brora players made vital contributions to thwart Strathspey – the first a great saving tackle by attacker Paul Brindle back on the edge of his own box to stop Strathspey’s Dominick Edwards getting through, quickly followed by Ally MacDonald’s vital interception of a through ball during another Strathspey break on the right.

Brora seemed to have weathered the storm and Paul Brindle was also active at the attacking end. In the 82nd minute he was only inches away from applying the finishing touch to James Ross’ right wing cross and came even closer a minute later when he hit the post after a left wing run and cross by Andrew Greig. His follow-up shot was blocked. It was third time lucky for Brindle 5 minutes from time when he turned in Craig Campbell’s right win run and cross at the far post to provide a two-goal cushion for the home side.

And Brora were to need that two-goal cushion as Strathspey wouldn’t lie down. Ryan MacLeod came close when his when he cut in to the right-hand edge of the box and his drive flashed across the Brora goal. The Grantown men pulled back a goal in added time when the impressive James Fraser ran to Dominick Edwards right sided run to score Strathspey’s third.

It was a measure of how well Strathspey played that Brora were hanging on nervously at the end and were relieved to hear the final whistle. They move on to a ‘must-win’ match against Cove next Saturday that is vital to both side’s prospects of catching pacesetters Buckie and need to be at their very best to prevail.
