The Press and Journal Big Game certainly lived up to it's billing this weekend at Dudgeon Park as Brora Rangers prevented Buckie Thistle from extending their lead at the top of the table.

Let's face it, if referee Alex Shepherd  had called this game off prior to the start, nobody could have seriously complained, as parts of the Dudgeon Park surface had laying water and was deteriorating by the minute.

With a cold easterly gale and driving torrential rain this was never going to be a game for the connoisseur and indeed so it proved.

As often the case playing with a gale at you back, the wind was more of a hindrance than help as first Brora and then Buckie, struggled to find the right momentum for the pass and over hit balls towards the School end were the order of the day.

This was a truly attritional battle where no quarter was asked or given and both defences had to be at their absolute best as underfoot conditions were hazardous and errors could be easily made.

Messrs Houston, Duff, Williamson and MacDonald were immense and gave the normally dangerous Buckie strike force no quarter. The returning Gavin Morrison had a great game, well supported by Graham and Maclean. Up front Greig, Sutherland and Macleod battled tirelessly.

Chances were few, but Brora took the lead after 38 minutes when a pin point cross from Sutherland found Scotty Graham's head and he skilfully put the ball beyond the Buckie goalkeeper.

The second half, saw a further deterioration in the weather, but Brora continued to show fight and desire, and deserved their second when Macleod was on hand to convert another great pass from Sutherland in the 74th minute.

Young keeper Ross Munro, produced a great save from a late Buckie free kick and his kicking and mastery of the wind was a highlight of the day.

Brora substitutes Gillespie, Pickles and Campbell were placed to maximum advantage and they and all the other players can take great credit for a display of big hearts.

In 92 minutes Buckie were awarded a penalty, for what, nobody knows, which was the only blip on a well refereed game by Mr Shepherd in the most difficult of conditions.
