The Press and Journal Big Game certainly lived up to it's billing this weekend at Dudgeon Park as Brora Rangers prevented Buckie Thistle from extending their lead at the top of the table.

The cold, strong wind blew towards the school end and drove the heavy rain to such an extent that it left puddles in various parts of Dudgeon Park and the conditions played a huge part in the ebb and flow of a game of 2 halves. Both sides are to be commended on playing an entertaining match in the correct spirit.

Brora lined up with teenage Ross County loanee Ross Munro continuing to deputise in goal for injured captain Joe Malin. The back four were Scott Houston and Ally MacDonald at right and left back respectively with Colin Williamson and Jamie Duff at centre back. Gavin Morrison returned after a long injury absence to bolster midfield alongside Martin MacLean and Scott Graham. The three up front were Kyle MacLeod, Zander Sutherland and Andrew Greig although, in an astute tactical variation by Ross Tokeley that suited the conditions, Sutherland played slightly deeper than normal resulting in him not having his back to play so much when Buckie attacked and this proved key, especially in the second half as Buckie attacked with the wind behind them. Sutherland used his experience to lead the line superbly as well as being instrumental in setting up both goals.

The first half hour was characterised by Brora, with the strong wind at their backs, consistently over-hitting forward passes and the wind helping blow the ball over the bye-line and Buckie’s defence holding out fairly comfortably without any serious threat to their goal. In fact, as is so often the case, it is the team playing against the strong wind that plays the more controlled football and so it proved with Buckie first to threaten through Chris Angus followed by home keeper Munro parrying away a shot by the Highland League’s leading goal scorer and ex-Brora striker John MacLeod.

The deadlock was broken by the home side on 38 minutes with a controlled move when Jamie Duff spread play from central defence to the right wing where Zander Sutherland brought the ball under control and sent over a pinpoint cross that was headed home decisively by the onrushing Scott Graham from 6 yards. This strike against the league leaders gave the Cattachs a fillip and the same combination almost succeeded again 5 minutes later but this time Graham headed over from Sutherland’s right wing corner. Just before half time, the Jags were dealt a serious blow when their highly influential No.10 Chris Angus was forced off with what looked like a hamstring injury and was replaced by Craig Cowie.

Brora substituted Andrew Greig at half time and brought on Dale Gillespie. This switch of a midfielder for a front man anticipated the likely balance of play in the second half with Buckie having the strong wind at their backs and looking to get back on terms. As Buckie manager Graeme Stewart conceded, Gillespie played superbly and he and Gavin Morrison dominated the midfield in the second half.

As expected, Buckie had the lion’s share of possession at the start of the second half and forced a series of corners that caused danger in the Cattachs goalmouth but the rearguard managed to clear their lines each time. Brora were counter-attacking quite frequently with Sutherland orchestrating most of it, instrumental in the hold-up play and bringing others into the game. Brora went 2-0 up against the run of play with just such a counter-attack in the 72nd minute. Zander linked the play then sent a low and fast brute of a cross from the right that ran all the way along the six yard line to the far post where young Kyle MacLeod gleefully beat the despairing dive of Jags keeper Daniel Bell to tuck the ball inside the far post.

This was a killer goal against the Jags and it certainly took the wind out of their sails (although not their backs!) and the home side survived until the final few minutes more comfortably than might have been expected. But the league leaders rallied again and three minutes from time Lewis MacKinnon must have thought his 25 yard free kick had ‘goal’ written all over it until young Ross Munro hurled himself to his right to push the effort away just under the junction of post and bar. However, Buckie did pull back a goal in the 2nd minute of added time that was the least they deserved although the manner of it mystified most observers. During a scramble in the home goalmouth, the referee pointed to the spot for a penalty. Not one Buckie payer appealed for a penalty although it later transpired that it was awarded for John MacLeod being pulled back in the box by Colin Williamson. In any case, Sam Urquhart duly dispatched the spot kick most decisively to give Buckie a consolation goal.

This crucial win just about keeps the Cattachs in the title race and the grit and determination with which it was achieved makes one wonder what might have been if we had shown this form on a more consistent basis. Although it could be said that it is still a 4 team title race, Buckie and Cove are the clear favourites with Brora and Formartine the outsiders.

One factor that may have a bearing as we hit the home straight is that Brora have taken steps to boost the depth of their squad which may prove important if tired legs, injuries and suspensions kick in to any significant level. The Brora bench for this match against the current league leaders was: Steven MacKay; John Pickles; Dale Gillespie; Blair MacLennan; Steven Ross; Craig Campbell; William Counsell. This is not to mention Ross Tokeley himself, James Ross, the Lisle brothers etc. Even if they fail to catch and overtake the other title challengers this season, such strength and depth of squad certainly gives cause for optimism in our defence of the Highland League Cup, for the North of Scotland Cup and for next season’s campaigns.
