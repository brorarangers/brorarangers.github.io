Buckie Thistle dismantled Brora in a display that showed exactly how they intended to bounce back from dropping points last weekend.

Opinion will be divided over which team came out on top going into the half time break as chances were created, opportunities missed and frailties exposed by both sides. But 3 goals in 9 minutes starting just before the hour mark left Brora in disarray, and Buckie practically unplayable.

The Press and Journal Big Match highlights will be online for all to see soon enough, and they should reflect a game played at a frenetic tempo with Brora's first chance coming in only the 2nd minute as Craig Campbell was denied by Ross Salmon in the Buckie goalmouth. Followed a minute later by a John Macleod shot which left Joe Malin untroubled.

It set the scene well for a first 45 minutes of end to end football, with Ally Macdonald unlucky not to open the scoring with a free kick which wasn't far over the crossbar, and Sam Urquart forcing Joe into action in the away goal.

Brora hung on desperately for a 15 minute period where our defence seemed increasingly fragile against an agile Buckie attacking line, but the favour was soon returned as Maclean and Morrison regained control in midfield and the Cattachs got back to playing the ball on the ground.

Despite tantalising chances on both sides, the score remained at 0-0 as Chris Fordyce blew for half time.

Brora came out the brighter side in the second 45 and whilst pushing Buckie back and relieving pressure on our defense there was a palpable air of expectation amongst the hugely outnumbered travelling support. It wasn't to last long.

A Lewis Mackinnon free kick past what appeared to be a poorly placed wall whistled past Joe Malin and into the back of the net. From the resulting kick off it was apparent Buckie had their tails up and the wall of noise from their jubilant support was driving them on.

A double substitution of Paul Brindle and Steven Ross did little to rectify our defensive errors of the first half, and John Macleod doubled the Jags score within 7 minutes of the opener.

The agony was trebled just 2 short minutes later from a Kevin Fraser strike, and with 25 minutes of normal time remaining it appeared inevitable that things were only going to get worse for a now beleaguered Brora side. It was. They were.

Another 10 minutes and John Maleod claimed his second from the edge of the box against his former Club, followed 7 minutes later by a straight red card for Dale Gillespie. Minutes from full time Joe appeared to have prevented Copeland from making it number 5 only to stumble backwards carrying the ball across the line with him.

That pretty much summed up our closing half hour of this table topping clash. League Championships are neither won nor lost in the first week of October. But if you want to make a statement about how you intent to deal with a previous disappointment and make it whilst playing your nearest rivals, Buckie signed theirs with a flourish.

It's our turn now to show how we react to this defeat. Keith come to Dudgeon Park on Saturday.
