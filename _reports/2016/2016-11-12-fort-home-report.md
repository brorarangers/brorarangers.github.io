Fort William felt the full force of a rampant Brora Rangers as they suffered their heaviest league loss this season.

This was a match between the top and bottom of the Highland League and throughout the 90 minutes the gulf in class was obvious. Brora, for whom recent signing Jamie Duff made his home debut at centre back, were without first team regulars Ross Tokely, Dale Gillespie and Gavin Morrison but still had too much firepower for a youthful Fort William side. 

To give an idea how one-sided this game was, as well as scoring 8 goals, the Cattachs had 3 more disallowed for offside, struck the woodwork twice, missed several sitters and the Fort’s keeper David Harrison pulled of a string of excellent saves to keep the score in single figures. Brora did play well throughout and, indeed, had their final pass been better weighted on a few occasions, the final score line could have been embarrassingly high.

To demonstrate his increasing goal threat, Steven Ross added another 4 goals to the 5 he scored in Brora’s previous 2 games and he also missed 3 sitters! Having missed the pre-season, he has got better and sharper and is showing his class with each game as he reaches the same level of match fitness as the rest of the squad. 

Second half substitute Craig Campbell chipped in with a brace, the influential Zander Sutherland scored and there was an own goal to make up the 8 goal tally.

Fort William employed an offside trap and lived dangerously by playing a high line. Brora were repeatedly caught – and the officials seemed very generous to the Fort defence in a few marginal decisions - but they also sprung it a few times.

The early period of the game saw the home side probing the Fort rear guard and they duly went ahead on 14 minutes when Steven Ross adroitly headed home Jamie Duff’s cross from the right. Duff played several excellent cross field balls behind the defence for the forward players to run onto and it promises to be another variant to add to Brora’s range of offensive options.

Nearly all the play was then concentrated in the Fort half and the Claggan Park men must have thought they were defending the Alamo such was the infinite variety of the incessant attacks from the Cattachs. After a couple of marginal offside decisions, Zander Sutherland put Brora 2 ahead in the 38th minute when he arrived in the middle to convert a chance set up by Ally MacDonald and Steven Ross. 

A couple of minutes later Sutherland shot home after Fort keeper Harrison parried a shot to him but his effort was adjudged offside. Given that the lineman’s flag was not raised before the parry and the Fort keeper was the last to play the ball then he must have played Sutherland onside so a curious decision. 

On the stroke of half time Steven Ross turned smartly in the D and bulleted the ball into the far corner for number 3. Fort must have been waiting to hear the half time whistle to allow them to regroup but a further Brora attack in added time saw a right wing cross by Alan Pollock turned past his own keeper at the near post by the unfortunate Richard Tawse although Zander Sutherland was waiting to apply the coup de grace if Tawse hadn’t intercepted to send Brora in at half time 4 up.

Colin Williamson received a knock shortly before half time and so the Cattachs replaced him at half time with Craig Campbell who joined Zander Sutherland as a twin striker. Ally MacDonald moved to centre back and Steven Ross dropped back to midfield where he continued to impress.

Five minutes into the second period, Alan Pollock sprung the offside trap on the right and played the ball in to Craig Campbell who somehow contrived to miss at the far post when it was easier to tap in and on 55 minutes it was Steven Ross’s turn to miss a sitter when he headed wide with a follow up after Craig Campbell’s first effort was blocked.

Fort replaced forward Craig Mainland with the more defensive-minded Daniel Highet but it did not stop the one way traffic. Craig Campbell did have the ball in the net on 58 minutes but once again the effort was chalked off for what must have been a very marginal offside decision and the following minute Zander Sutherland was only a whisker away from a right wing cross with Jamie Duff also in attendance waiting to pounce on any loose ball.

Brora then brought on player-manager Grant Munro and Paul Brindle for Andrew Grieg and Alan Pollock on in the 62nd minute and 4 minutes later the Cattachs went nap with an excellent goal. Paul Brindle delivered an inviting left wing cross to the far post where it was headed back across goal by Zander Sutherland and dispatched high into the roof of the net by Steven Ross for his hat-trick.

Number 6 arrived on 72 minutes when Craig Campbell finished off after Jamie Duff’s header came back off the bar. This was followed by an almighty stramash when it was unbelievable that the visitor’s goal managed to survive intact. James Pickles left wing cross was met by Martin MacLean whose header hit the far post and there was then a series of last ditch blocks on the line. It was almost comical to see the crazy pinball within the six yard box and on this occasion the Fort goal led a charmed life.

In the last 10 minutes, Martin MacLean beat offside and his through ball to Ally MacDonald was there for the taking but again the net was missed. A minute later, Brora had the ball in the net again but for the 3rd time in the match, it was disallowed for offside. 4 minutes from time, however, Craig Campbell grabbed his second and Brora’s 7th goal, connecting at the far post with Ally MacDonald’s left wing cross. The only yellow card of the match was then shown to Fort William’s Iain Foggo for a foul on Paul Brindle. Just before full time Steven Ross brought his goal haul to 4 with Brora’s 8th goal after converting Grant Munro’s pass after yet another siege in the Fort box.
