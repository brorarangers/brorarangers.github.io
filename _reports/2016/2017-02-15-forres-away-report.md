On an unseasonably balmy evening at Forres, the Cattachs put in a workmanlike performance against a big strong and physical Forres side which included Alan Pollock who recently moved from Brora to the Can Can's.

The goalless first half was an even affair, with Forres having the better of the early chances, and Ross Munro needed to be at his best to gather in a well struck effort from Soane.

At the other end Brora too had their chances and Sutherland and Morrison both went close with well struck drives.

Forres suffered an early set back when regular keeper Stuart Knight had to limp from the field of play with a reoccurring hamstring injury and was replaced by the substitute stopper.

Both sides had further chances but a goalless first half was an equitable outcome. The visitors certainly had the better of the early chances in the second half with Craig Campbell going close on a couple of occasions.

With time running down, Brora Manager Ross Tokely substituted Campbell with Steven Ross which yielded immediate results. A scramble in the Forres box, saw the ball run loose to Ross who poked it home from a yard with his first touch of the game.

Brora maintained the pressure from the restart and within 6 minutes Steven Ross had netted his and Brora's second with the Cattachs now comfortably in control.

With 5 minutes remaining Forres pulled one back when Grant sent a glancing header past Munro, which ensured a nervous final couple of minutes, but Brora took the honours as worthy winners.
