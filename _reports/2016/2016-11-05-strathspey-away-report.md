Five goals and a clean sheet put the wintery weather to the back of the Red's minds at Seafield Park.

As new boy Jamie Duff made his debut in the red of Brora Rangers and September signing Steven Ross added to his goal tally again, Steven Mackay made what may be his final appearance for the Club he captained to two League titles.

Sid warmed the cockles of the travelling Brora support with a red hot 30 minutes when he came on as substitute at a near baltic Seafield Park. It seem fated that his goal also turned out to be the last kick of the match, and saw emotional scenes from Mackay and the travelling supporters who had braved the cold tundra of Grantown on Spey.
 
After a totally dominant first half Brora went in at the interval with just a solitary goal lead thanks to a penalty strike from Dale Gillespie, which the keeper did well to get a hand to but the ball went into the net off the post.
 
The second half started sharply for the Cattachs and Steven Ross doubled the advantage with a well taken finish after some good work from Greig. Despite the continuing dominance of Brora, Strathspey had 5 across the back and Brora struggled to control the ball at the last pass, with some excellent work from Maclean, Gillespie and Sutherland going to waste for want of a final telling ball.
 
Manager Grant Munro hooked the hard working but largely ineffective Brindle back into the dug out, which gave Mackay his chance, and his presence completely changed the dynamic of the game. Perhaps knowing that this may be his last game Mackay threw himself right into the guts of the front line tussle and proved a real handful for the home side's centre backs.
 
The previous defensive aerial dominance of Strathspey was dismantled by Mackay and then Campbell as Brora turned every attack into a goal scoring opportunity, and only the Strathy keeper, Stewart Black, and the woodwork kept the score at 2-0 . Andrew Greig had a excellent game and benefited greatly from the vision of Jamie Duff who on several occasions delivered 40 yard cross field balls behind the defence for Greig to run on to.
 
The  Brora pressure was relentless and Campbell made it 3-0 when he bullied his way past the Thistle defence and planted his half volley into the top right hand corner of the net. The workmanlike Gillespie made it 4-0 with a thunderbolt of a strike from 30 yards giving the home team stopper no chance and then Mackay capped the performance off with a wonderful goal, a fitting end to the game.
 
Speaking after the match an emotional Mackay paid tribute to the Club and its supporters and whilst the current week will no doubt bring further transfer talk, Mackay certainly showed on this performance that despite his advancing years he lacks absolutely nothing in commitment nor fitness.
 
Assistant Manager Steven MacDonald was pleased with the result, but disappointed with some of the passing in the final third of the field, something they intend to work hard on in training this week. “We need to find our final pass. It’s a lot easier for the ball to do the work, but overall it was another 3 points in the locker at an important time of the season. We now have a run of three home games before Cove visit us in December so we hope to continue our momentum”
 
With both Buckie Thistle and Cove Rangers contesting the Aberdeenshire Trophy Final, the 3 points obtained takes Brora Rangers to the head of the table, and with Buckie having had to travel to Wick on Wednesday the race to the championship will ebb and flow right to the end through until April.
