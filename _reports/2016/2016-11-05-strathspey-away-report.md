Five goals and a clean sheet put the wintery weather to the back of the Red's minds at Seafield Park.

As new boy Jamie Duff made his debut in the red of Brora Rangers and September signing Steven Ross added to his goal tally again, Steven Mackay made what may be his final appearance for the Club he captained to two League titles.

It was Steven Mackay who warmed the cockles of the travelling Brora support with a red hot 30 minutes when he came on as substitute at a near baltic  Seafield Park on Saturday.

After a totally dominating first half, Brora went in at the interval with just a solitary goal lead thanks to a penalty strike from Dale Gillespie. The second half started sharply for the Cattachs and Steven Ross doubled the advantage with a well taken finish.

Despite the continuing dominance of Brora, Strathspey had 5 across the back and Brora struggled to control the ball at the last pass. Manager Grant Munro hooked Brindle back into the dug out, which gave Mackay his chance and his presence completely changed the dynamic of the game.

The previous defensive ariel dominance of Strathy was dismantled by Mackay and then Campbell as Brora turned every attack Into a goal scoring opportunity and only the Strathy keeper Stewart Black and the woodwork kept the score at 2-0

However the Brora pressure was relentless and Campbell, Mackay and Gillespie added three more deserved goals to leave the final score 5-0 to the visitors.

Mackay's performance was hailed by the travelling support as perhaps the best 30 minutes by a player this season, and new new boy Jamie Duff looked every inch a class presence at the centre of the defence.
