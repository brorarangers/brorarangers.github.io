Eight second half goals at The Links in Tain saw Brora Rangers progress to the Second Round of the North of Scotland Cup.

On a day where the Brora Rangers Legends recorded a famous 5-3 victory over the Supporters, those travelling the short distance to Tain were rwarded by an emphatic 9 goal victory over our North Caledonian League neighbours, St Duthus.

The Tain Club held on well to keep the score at 0-1 at half time, despite efforts from Kyle Macleod, Zander and Chubbs. However, Brora changed up a gear in the second half, with Andrew Greig and Steven Ross scoring two apiece within the opening 10 minutes.

We now await the meeting of Strathspey Thistle and Nairn County on the 8th April to see who we meet in the 2nd Round
