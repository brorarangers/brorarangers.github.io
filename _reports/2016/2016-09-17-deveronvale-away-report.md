Despite another welcome 3 points, Brora Rangers left Banff knowing that they should have registered a greater scoreline. 

On a beautiful autumnal afternoon and on a perfect looking pitch, conditions were set up for an entertaining game, with the wide expanse of Princess Royal Park inviting fluent open play. 

Brora, buoyant from a hard fought derby win against Wick Academy during the week, started brightly with both Sutherland and Grieg looking sharp and dangerous on the wings.  

After a early Vale chance which Colin Williamson acted quickly to block, Brora comfortably bossed the first 45 minutes and only some outstanding saves from James Blanchard ensured the score remained 2-0 to the visitors at the break. 

Brora continued to boss the second half, but some careless defending from John Pickles allowed Deveronvale to score and add an unrealistic outcome to the final scoreline. 

Brora were ahead after 9 minutes when Steven Mackay pounced on some sloppy defending and scored from 12 yards out. Brora continued to press and had countless further opportunities but a mix of poor finishing and great goalkeeping kept the advancing Cattachs at bay. 

However a second goal arrived on the stroke of half time when Martin Maclean headed in following a great cross from Pickles. 

The second half saw more of the same, but Deveronvale were organised at the back and again when Brora did break through, Blanchard was in outstanding form. 

On 80 minutes Vale pulled one back totally against the run of play when Keith bundled the ball home after a Malin save, and despite a spirited last 10 minutes Brora held on to take the 3 points back to Sutherland.
