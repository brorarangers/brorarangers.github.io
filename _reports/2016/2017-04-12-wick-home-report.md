Brora Rangers dominated the first half of this Derby encounter to lengthen their winning streak at the end of the season.

The blustery cold conditions did little to dampen the enthusiasm of the Cattach team as they ran time after time at the Wick defence, nor the pleasure of the Brora supporters as their side cruised to a fairly comfortable win.

Goals from Andrew Greig and Steven Mackay delighted the home support as Ross Tokely fielded the same starting 11 as played against Huntly on Saturday.
