Brora Rangers’ opening home match was certainly a game of two halves with the high balls into the box of the first half being meat and drink to the tall and rugged Forres defence before a second half switch to playing on the deck undid the Can Cans.

Brora started by playing an attacking formation with a 3-5-2 so fluid that with the wing backs pushing on at every opportunity it was often more like 3-3-4. The opening 10 minutes were all Brora with the Moray men’s at times over-physical defence working hard to frustrate and keep the Cattachs out.

But after mounting their first attack after 12 minutes Forres gradually came more into the match and a swift one-two saw Martin Groat screw a 20 yard shot well wide of the far post.

The first half was generally poor fare with only a few half chances being created. Most of these were created by Forres although neither keeper was unduly troubled and the Can Cans finished the half the stronger side with their two former Brora players Liam Baxter and Scott Graham well to the fore.

In the second half Brora started playing much more on the deck and they certainly started troubling the Forres defence. The big centre backs who had looked so comfortable and secure in the first half when dealing with the ariel threat now looked vulnerable with Bro-
ra stretching play and getting in behind them. Six minutes into the second period Craig Campbell turned in the box and dispatched a 15 yard snapshot low into the net to break the deadlock.

This initiated a period of intense Brora pressure with the old attacking fluidity flowing back into the home side’s moves. On 57 minutes, Colin Williamson sent a header just inches wide of the post and a minute later James Ross’ header was also just a whisker the wrong side of the post. On the hour a beautiful net-bound flicked header by Steven MacKay from 15 yards was touched over by Forres keeper Stuart Knight.

But it was not all one way traffic and on 64 minutes Forres striker Lee Fraser sent a header well over from a corner when well positioned just under the crossbar. This was a wake-up call to underline the vulnerability of a slender single goal lead and another Colin Williamson header from a corner once again was agonisingly just wide of the far post.

Brora were dominating this phase of the game and, a few minutes after coming on, Brora substitute Paul Brindle went on a long direct run down the inside left channel in the 79th minute and was chopped in the box for a stonewall penalty that resulted in a booking for Stuart Soane. Dale Gillespie dispatched the spot-kick with aplomb to put the Cattachs 2-0 up. Brora finished the game well on top and playing good flowing football that fully stretched the visitors. This was emphasised in added time when Paul Brindle deftly steered a left wing corner on into far corner of the net to complete the scoring.

There was just time for Forres’ Graham Fraser to commit a nasty foul where he could consider himself lucky to only receive a yellow card before the final whistle. 

This summed up Forres’ approach to the game where they clearly had a plan to try and disrupt Brora’s free flowing football. A lot of Highland League teams will find them difficult to break down this season.
