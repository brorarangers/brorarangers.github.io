After a disappointing week when they suffered an odd goal defeat to title rivals Cove followed by an unlucky Irn-Bru Cup elimination at the hands of Peterhead, Brora Rangers got back to winning ways with a convincing victory against Rothes.

This season, the visitors are much improved as demonstrated by a creditable draw against Inverurie and they sought to attack the Cattachs on the break at every opportunity. However, an early goal settled the home side and allowed them to control the rhythm of the game. In the 5th minute player-manager Grant Munro played a long angled pass over the top of the Speysiders defence for Paul Brindle to run onto, round the keeper and open the scoring. 10 minutes later a flowing move on the left flank should have resulted in Brindle and Brora’s second goal after Zander Sutherland’s pin-point cross to the far post required just to be touched in but the striker didn’t make proper contact and the ball went wide. A couple of minutes later Sutherland himself almost got on the score sheet with a 20 yard drive that flashed just over the centre of the bar with Rothes keeper Sean MacIntosh beaten.

Rothes attacked as and when they could and on 18 minutes centre back Nathan Sharp sent a good header just over the home bar from Scott Davidson’s free kick. Brora punished Rothes for that miss by going straight up the park and doubling their lead with a goal by right back James Ross who picked the ball up on the right hand corner of the box and sent a sweet drive low into the far corner of the net.

With Brora 2 up inside 20 minutes the match settled into a pattern of the Cattachs knocking it about and probing for openings whilst Rothes tried to feed off scraps of possession. Andrew Greig was prominent on the left flank for the home side during this spell. One delightful dink into the box was headed wide by Zander Sutherland at the far stick and another jinking run and cross by Greig this time saw Sutherland’s header blocked. Sutherland then went on a mazy dribble himself that ended with his low 12 yard shot from the right hand edge of the box being deflected for a corner and he followed this up by blazing another shot over.

Zander Sutherland then turned provider with a deft 25 yard free kick that Colin Williamson headed over. The Speysiders only riposte to this was an angled 20 yard drive from Finlay Stables that was cleared for a corner. Just before half time Stables was booked for dissent – the only booking of a clean match played in the right spirit – and the half ended with a loose ball on the edge of the box volleyed over by that man Sutherland again.

The 2nd half started with Brora on the front foot again and a couple of minutes in Paul Brindle squared in the box to Alan Pollock who volleyed just past the near post with the outside of his left foot.

Rothes then had their best spell of possession of the match with most of action in the Brora half but they failed to carve out any clear chances. They were made to pay for this lack of a cutting edge on 54 minutes when, after a spell of slick inter-passing, Zander Sutherland finally found his range and opened his account with a clinical shot from 12 yards across keeper Sean MacIntosh and into the right hand corner.

Shortly after the goal the MacKessack Park men brought on Craig MacMillan for Nathan Sharp and Brora replaced Paul Brindle and Andrew Greig with Steven MacKay and Craig Campbell. Rothes then had their first dangerous attempt on target. Ruari Watt played a through ball into the inside left channel that was picked up by Richard Henderson who turned inside and unleashed a rasping drive that Joe Malin did well to turn away.

On 70 minutes player manager Grant Munro brought himself off to be replaced by Scott Houston and a couple of minutes later Zander Sutherland doubled his goal tally when his left wing cross sailed perfectly over everyone and into the far corner of the roof of the net. Give the man a coconut for that one!

Rothes replaced Finlay Stables with Callum MacIntosh before play resumed and the prevailing pattern of play resumed with Alan Pollock’s angled ball from the right flank being volleyed back across goal by Steven MacKay. Unfortunately it went beyond the far post with the Rothes keeper beaten all ends up. Brora were now exerting consistent and concerted pressure and 10 minutes from the end MacKay’s through ball found Craig Campbell in a 1 on 1 situation with Sean MacIntosh who managed to block the shot with his legs.

This reprieve was short lived as, after the Cattachs laying siege to the visitors’ goal for a couple of minutes, Ally MacDonald ran on to a loose ball coming back into his path and sent a daisy cutter inside the near post giving MacIntosh no chance to give Brora a nap hand of 5. There was just time for Alan Pollock to show his training ground skills by swivelling twice on the right hand edge of the penalty box before pulling his shot beyond the far post. It was a piece of skill that deserved better.

Rothes will be pleased to have avoided a repetition of the 11 goal thumping they received at Dudgeon Park at the start of last season and in truth there was no comparison between that Rothes performance and this one. Brora will be pleased not just with the win but with the manner of it as the fluent passing and moving of the recent past was well to the fore and bodes well for the rest of the season.
