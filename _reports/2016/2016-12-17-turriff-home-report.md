Brora Rangers prevailed in a match in which the hosts had most of the play but in which Turriff United were clearly on top for the first 15 minutes of the second half.

The win was crucial and takes the Cattachs back to the top of the league although all 3 of their main rivals have games in hand on them. However, none of their rivals managed to win to make it an even more satisfactory weekend for Brora.

Turriff were without 9 players and as a result fielded a less experienced side. Gavin Morrison was the only injury absentee for the home team although Ally MacDonald and Alan Pollock were also unavailable and, as a result, both sides only had 3 outfield players on the bench. Colin Williamson deputised for MacDonald at left back with Ross Tokely and Jamie Duff at centre back and John Pickles started at right back. Dale Gillespie and Martin MacLean were in central midfield with Zander Sutherland and Andrew Greig wide whilst Paul Brindle and Craig Campbell were up front as the Cattachs started with a 4-4-2 formation.

This was a match of several distinct phases. Brora were in total control for the first half hour. Andrew Greig was lively and was troubling the Turriff defence even more than normal by switching between wings and linking well with Zander Sutherland on the right rather than sticking to his customary left flank only. They applied pressure from the start. Colin Williamson headed Greig’s right wing cross wide of the far post as early as the 3rd minute and on 6 minutes Ross Tokely’s pull back from the left corner of the box was blazed over the bar by Dale Gillespie.

Martin MacLean came close a minute later with a 25-yard drive that was well held by young Turriff keeper Aaron Sherman. This pattern of Brora attacks continued until a rare Turriff break just before the half hour mark saw the best chance of the game so far. A comparatively harmless through ball looked to be meat and drink for Ross Tokely until he slipped over allowing Turriff’s Paul Young through for a one on one with Joe Malin. The Brora captain spread himself well and Young’s effort just shaved the bar.

It’s amazing how many times that a team that is utterly dominant can be undone by just one chance at the other end and this was a real let-off for Brora. And at this point, Joe Malin still hadn’t touched the ball!

The scare seems to galvanise the home side and 3 minutes later they opened the scoring when Andrew Greig, operating from the right at this point, delivered a searching ball into the area and Paul Brindle tucked it away to put the Cattachs ahead. The last quarter of the first half was a much more even affair with chances falling to both sides. The men from the Haughs came very close to an equaliser when David Booth’s header from a left wing cross flashed just past the near post before Zander Sutherland’s header from Andrew Greig’s left wing cross was held at the far post by Aaron Sherman. Back came Turra and Lewis Davidson’s cross from the right edge of the box was headed clear by Brora centre back Jamie Duff and the second ball delivered on the right by David Booth was headed over his own bar by Duff. This must have inspired Turra full back Lewis Davidson because, not to be outdone, he hacked a James Pickles right wing cross past his own post to bring a frantic finale to the first half.

Having fought their way back into the match in the last quarter of the first half, the visitors positively bossed the first quarter of the second half. On 51 minutes, Joe Malin showed his class with a magnificent series of three saves that left the Turriff strikers shaking their heads in disbelief. He twice denied Nicholas Gray, blocking his ferocious drive, then blocking Gray’s follow up before finally, when the loose ball broke to him, leaping to parry behind David Booth’s goal-bound drive. There can have been no better display of goalkeeping at its best than this at any level anywhere in the country this weekend.

Sadly, for Brora, their reprieve only lasted for a couple of minutes. Their defending suddenly seemed jittery as Turriff came at them and several loose balls were played at the back in dangerous positions. From one such loose ball on the left, Turriff gained possession and when the cross went into the box, Cameron Bowden, up from the back, was fastest to the loose ball and used his strength to score the equaliser. Five minutes later it could have been worse. Paul Young’s rising drive from the angle of the box just shaved the crossbar.

Brora had a good chance to retake the lead on 68 minutes when Craig Campbell pulled down a through ball on the left hand edge of the box but keeper Aaron Sherman smothered his effort at the near post. A couple of minutes later acting manager Steve MacDonald brought Campbell off and replaced him with Scott Lisle. He also reverted to 3 at the back and pushed Zander Sutherland into a more central role.

This change certainly handed the initiative back to the home side. A dangerous left wing cross by Andrew Greig was hacked behind once again by Lewis Davidson and, after a series of blocked shots on the Turra goal, Dale Gillespie’s 20 yard free kick shaved the roof of the net. And 5 minutes after coming on, Scott Lisle latched on to a loose ball and sent a rasping shot into the net to restore Brora’s lead and, this time, they didn’t look like losing it as they continued to dominate in attack. Paul Brindle came close to adding a third on 3 separate occasions and both Zander Sutherland and Dale Gillespie also came close.

The match very nearly had a sting in the tail for Brora that had home hearts in their mouths. In added time, Joe Malin made a point blank save from Cameron Booth’s shot to protect the 3 points that seemed all the more precious when news came through that Buckie had lost at Forres, Fraserburgh had continued their good recent run of results against Cove by holding them and Formartine had only drawn at Fort William.

Not too many people would have predicted that and it shows there are a few twists and turns before the fat lady sings. Whilst Buckie and Cove still have it in their own hands, they have been clawed back. They meet at Buckie on Saturday, after the Jags have played the rearranged midweek fixture at Wick so, if Brora can get a result at Lossie on Friday, it will make for a very interesting festive period.
