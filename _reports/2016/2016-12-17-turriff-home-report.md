Scott Lisle played the role of Super-Sub on Saturday as he rifled home his shot from 20 yards to send Brora Rangers back to the top of the table.

On a weekend where Brora Rangers were the only team in the current top four to claim all 3 points, Lisle's goal was representative of a squad who looked hungrier and more determined on the day.

Whilst Brora effectively controlled the opening 45 minutes, Turriff were unfortunate not to open the scoring on the half hour mark. An error that was quickly punished by a home goal from Paul Brindle.

Despite the heroic efforts of Joe Malin at the start of the second half, untidy defending saw Bowden snatch an equaliser for the visitors and Brora appeared to lose control of the game.

However, in the style of a side who have no intention of giving up on a title challenge again this season, control was regained, and Scott Lisle ensured the 3 points stayed at Dudgeon Park.
