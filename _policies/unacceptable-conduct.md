Brora Rangers Football Club will not tolerate unacceptable conduct from the Club's employees, committee members, players or supporters at Dudgeon Park or at any other away football stadia.

**Unacceptable Conduct Policy**

Brora Rangers Football Club aims to create and maintain an environment where spectators can enjoy the game of football, safe in the knowledge that they are free from all forms of harassment, abuse, unacceptable or disorderly conduct.

**Definition**

Unacceptable conduct is conduct which is violent or disorderly. Conduct is violent where there is:

- Actual, attempted or threatened physical violence against a person or persons.

- Intentional damage to property.

Disorderly conduct involves any activity which stirs up or sustains, or is likely, or is designed to stir up or sustain hatred or ill will against or towards individuals or groups of people because of:

- Gender

- Age

- Colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin

- Membership or presumed membership, of a religious group or of a social or cultural group with perceived religious affiliation

- Sexual orientation

- Transgender identity

- Disability

- Using threatening, abusive or insulting words or conduct both verbal and non-verbal

- Displaying writing or any other item which is threatening, abusive or insulting.

**Racism**

Brora Rangers Football Club condemns racism in any form, either on or off the pitch. Brora Rangers Football Club aims to create and maintain a working and spectating environment free from racial harassment and abuse. Everyone connected with Brora Rangers Football Club has a responsibility to prevent racial harassment or abuse.

A racist incident is defined by Brora Rangers Football Club as any incident that is perceived to be racist by the victim, or any other person.

Racial harassment is defined by Brora
Rangers Club to be any verbal, physical, written or visible abuse that is based on a person's race, ethnic background, colour, nationality, language or cultural background - and is considered to be unwanted, unacceptable and offensive to the person.

Proven racial harassment or abuse will lead to action being taken against spectators and will be reported to the police and may result in a life ban from Brora Rangers Football Club.

Brora Rangers Football Club will give their full support to the police in any criminal actions.

All employees, committee members, players and servants of the Club have a responsibility to make it clear that such behaviour by anyone connected with Brora Rangers Football Club is unacceptable.

Supporters should also note that racist taunts and abusive or threatening behaviour will not be tolerated by Brora Rangers Football Club and will be encouraged to condemn and report such behaviour.

Any supporters (home or visiting) behaving in this way will face eviction from the stadium and their actions will be reported to the police. Season ticket holders who conduct themselves in this manner face having their season ticket revoked and all spectators face the prospect of a life ban from the Dudgeon Park.

Brora Rangers Football Club fully supports and will promote the â€˜Show Racism the Red Card Campaign', details of which can be found at [www.srtrc.org](www.srtrc.org)

Any person engaging in unacceptable conduct may be subject to any, or a combination of the following:

- Removal from Dudgeon Park or away stadium

- Suspension from attending home matches involving Brora Rangers Football Club

- Indefinite ban from attending home matches involving Brora Rangers Football Club

- Suspension or ban from holding Brora Rangers Football Club membership

**Responsibility**

Everyone associated with the Club has a responsibility to prevent and discourage any form of abuse and as such are responsible not only for their own actions but also those of others.

We would therefore encourage everyone to bring to the Club's attention, any incident or behaviour, of individuals or groups of individuals, deemed to be in breach of this policy.

Whilst it is appreciated that behaviour such as that listed above involves the minority of individuals in our society, Brora Rangers Football Club wishes to ensure that we continue to maintain the highest standards both on and off the field of play and that the name 'Brora Rangers Football Club' is associated with good and sporting behaviour at all times.
