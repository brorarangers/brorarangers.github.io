Former Celtic, Ross County and Elgin City goalkeeper, Joe is one of Brora Rangers' biggest assets, not only between the sticks but also as a source of dressing room motivation.

The Belshill boy is widely regarded as the best keeper in the Highland League.

With 2 SPFL Challenge Cup medals, Scottish Division 2 and Scottish Division 1 Champions medals and a Scottish Cup Runners Up medal to add to the 2 Highland League Champions, Highland League Cup and 4 Nos Cup winners honours that he's earned in his time at Brora it's going to be hard to argue with that opinion.
