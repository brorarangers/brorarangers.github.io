Scott signed for us back in 2013 and if you're looking for a man to mop up any danger at the back - this is him.

Scott is one of the most composed players in the League and has picked up 2 League Champions and 3 North of Scotland Cup medals along with a couple of Highland Amatuer Cups in his time with Avoch.

It is unusual to see Scott picking up cautions, but even more surprising this season is that he's finally added goal scoring to his list of talents.
