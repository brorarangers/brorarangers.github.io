Alan signed from Nairn County in July 2016 after catching our eye in several games, not least the Highland League Cup Final at Grant Street Park.

Alan opened his scoring account with the Cattach's at Ross County's Global Energy Stadium in our IRN-BRU Cup victory and his second competitive game with us.
