Grant joined us back in October 2013 and quickly established himself as a vital member of the Brora defense that only conceded a record breaking 16 goals in his first season.

There is no questioning the experience Grant brought to Dudgeon Park as a player, and now his leadership qualities are coming to the fore as our First Team manager.
