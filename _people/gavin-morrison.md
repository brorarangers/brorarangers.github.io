Our midfield engine, Gavin joined us back in July 2013 from Caledonian Thistle after loan spells at both Elgin and Grindavick.

Gavin has committed himself to the Club until the end of season 2019-20 in a contract extention deal agreed in April, much to the delight of everyone at Brora.

In his own words, "I have dedicated my future to Brora Rangers as I feel like a part of this club, and also respect how well everybody from the Board, the players and the supporters have treated me over the last 4 years". That's exactly the type of attitude that wins you friends at Brora Rangers. His uncompromising, hard working displays on the pitch doesn't do us any harm either.
