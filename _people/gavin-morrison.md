Our midfield engine, Gavin joined us back in July 2013 from Caledonian Thistle after loan spells at both Elgin and Grindavick.

Gavin would be the first name pencilled into any supporters team sheet, and his absence for long periods last season was a blow to the team.

Currently training to become a Physical Training Instructor, Gavin played in the first ever SPL Highland Derby and ran out 3-1 winners.
