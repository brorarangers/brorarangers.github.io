Originally signed from Clachnacuddin back in the summer of 2015, Paul recently extended his contract until the end of the 2019 season.

 Paul's 30 League goals saw him crowned the 2015-16 Highland League top scorer, and our Clubman of the Year for the same season. Injury hampered his goal scoring exploits last season, but 11 goals from 13 starts shows the danger he poses to any defence.
