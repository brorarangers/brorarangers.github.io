When you pick up a Player of the Year Award you know you have to be doing something right. Ally obviously does plenty right.

He has picked up a Sun Conference League Player of the Year and Embry-Riddle Player of the Year awards from his time in The States, along with a Players Player and Fans Player of the Year awards here at Brora.

Add to that his Highland League and North of Scotland Cup winners medals, his importance in our success is obvious.

Normally filling the Left Back position, Ally is always hungry to push forward.
