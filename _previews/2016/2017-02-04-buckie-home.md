This Saturday sees the current Highland League leaders visit Dudgeon Park. Buckie Thistle have a 3 point advantage over us, with a game in hand.

Whilst The Jags certainly gave the Cattachs a lesson back in October, at a time when Inverurie Locos were the only side to deny them 3 points, Fraserburgh, Cove and Turriff have since proved that they are not invincible.

Once again Brora get the honours of the Press and Journal 'Big Game' treatment, and without a doubt it is an important match for both Clubs. The reaction of Brora Manager, Ross Tokely, in his post match interview last weekend after our defeat to Fraserburgh will leave few in doubt of his intention to produce a strong performance from the squad. Buckie meanwhile will be aware that this is a key match if they are to fly the League flag at Victoria Park next season.

To add to the anticipation of this meeting, Brora Rangers are holding their second Hall of Fame Dinner on Friday 3rd February. Who will be joining our six existing members?

There is still time to get your tickets for the event by contacting the Club at [brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com](mailto:brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com), and if you haven't made your vote yet, send us your 3 nominations by Private Message on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/) pages.
