We end November with the return leg of our opening game of the month, as the Strathspey Jags come to town.

With the original fixture list arranging for us to visit Forres Mechanics, and for Strathspey to head to their Buckie namesakes, progression in the William Hill Scottish Cup for both of our intended opponents sees this change to the original schedule.

Our [Match Report](/2016/11/05/strathspey-away-report/) from our trip to Seafield Park reminds us that the Grantown squad were well organised at home and succeeded in holding the dominant Reds at bay for much of the game.

After last weekend's disappointing result we can't afford any slip up on Saturday. The League Table shows only too clearly how important Goal Difference could prove to be again this season.

We still have some spaces available for our [Match Day Hospitality](/2016/08/12/hospitable-hospitality/) this weekend. Either [Russell](mailto: russell.jaffrey@btinternet.com) or [David](david@cairngormgroup.co.uk) will be more than happy to look after your arrangements for that.

Our heroic Groundsman, Sandy, will be thinking little about team tactics, player availability or whether Russell is practising his cooking in preparation for his match day guests. Last weekend saw 5 games postponed due to frozen pitches, and the weather forecast doesn't seem to be suggesting an end to this cold snap. However, if anyone can get the Dudgeon turf ready for a game this weekend, Sandy is the man you'd want in your team.

We will keep you updated through our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) and [Facebook](www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc) pages closer to the day.

Finally, good luck to Buckie Thistle, Formartine Utd, Forres Mechanics and Wick Academy as they represent the Highland League in the 3rd round of the Scottish Cup.
