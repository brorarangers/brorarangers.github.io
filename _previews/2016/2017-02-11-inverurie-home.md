Brora start the defence of the Highland League Cup against Inverurie Loco Works in what promises to be a cracking game.

In a repeat of last season's 1st Round tie, Inverurie willtravel to Dudgeon Park on the 11th February. Last time round we had a string of victories over the Aberdeenshire club at our back and we ran out comfortable 4-1 victors to take us into a couple of the most nailbiting matches to grace a Cup competition.

Since then the Locos have provided a sterner test for the Cattachs.
