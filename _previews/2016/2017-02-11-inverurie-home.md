Brora start the defence of the Highland League Cup against Inverurie Loco Works in what promises to be a cracking game.

In a repeat of last season's 1st Round tie, Inverurie will travel to Dudgeon Park on the 11th February. Last time round we had a string of victories over the Aberdeenshire club at our back and we ran out comfortable 4-1 victors to take us into a couple of the most nailbiting matches to grace a Cup competition.

Since then the Locos have provided a sterner test for the Cattachs.

We are happy to have the Highland League Cup in the trophy cabinet, we are not keen to pass it on to anyone else just yet. The first step to achieving that takes place on Saturday 11th February at 3pm. See you there.
