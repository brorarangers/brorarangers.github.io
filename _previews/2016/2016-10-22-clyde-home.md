Match Day is nearly here ... The 2nd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup, Highland League v League 2, Brora Rangers v Clyde.

Whilst both ourselves and Clyde FC have our eyes firmly set on a League title and another punt at promotion, the Scottish Cup is a fine distraction and everything points to this being an entertaining game of football.

We've already published a couple of website articles in the run up to today's match, and regular followers of our online news will already be aware of the fine pedigree Clyde have in this competition; 3 times winners, and the distinction of holding on to the trophy for the longest single period.

Whilst neither of us will be planning a party at Hampden next year, let that take nothing away from the kudos, and financial reward, of a good run in the Cup. And lets be honest, the kudos will be doubled for a Highland League Club gaining an SPFL scalp.

Our last competitive game against the Bully Wee was only 3 short seasons ago, when Brora Rangers headed down to Broadwood in this same competition.

Whilst we were on the crest of a wave after picking up the North of Scotland Cup, and were on our way to picking up the League title, further progression in the Scottish Cup was not to be. Despite an early goal from Zander, Clyde finished 2-1 victors on that occasion.

This isn't Clyde's first trip to Dudgeon Park either, Barry Ferguson and his squad had a mini Far North tour as part of their 2015-16 pre-season. On that occasion, despite several chances at both ends, the game ended in a 0-0 stalemate.

It would be very neat if we were to tidy up the stats with a home victory this time round. But we all know football doesn't work like that.

Clyde currently sit in 3rd place in League 2 and come into this game on the back of a single goal victory in a tight meeting against newly promoted Edinburgh City at Meadowbank Stadium, whilst confidence will be high in the Cattachs squad after a 1-4 victory over Formartine Utd at North Lodge Park.

Today, at 3pm, this tale will be played out at 16 grounds across the country. Annan Athletic will be expecting to deal with Lowland League new boys East Stirlingshire; Arbroath will be expecting to outdo Stirling University; Berwick Rangers will be expecting to progress at the expense of Hawick Royal Albert ... and so on. 

The Highland and Lowland League squads need to be at their best to overcome opposition from the higher leagues. Brora Rangers will need to turn in the type of performance we've seen at North Lodge Park, the dominance they demonstrated against Keith, the determination they showed at Harmsworth Park and the belief they exuded not so long ago at Palmerston Park.

It's possible, that's the beauty of the Cup. Formartine Utd proved it. Nairn County proved it. Home advantage can make all the difference.

The man that opened the scoring in our last William Hill Scottish Cup meeting with Clyde, Zander Sutherland, certainly believes that.
