It's Round 1 of The William Hill Scottish Cup this weekend, and we're off west to Claggan Park.

In an all Highland League tie we take arguably our most scenic trip of the season along the Great Glen for what hopefully turns out to be a great game.

The Fort haven't had much luck at home so far this season, and we don't want to see that change before 5pm on Saturday. Whilst we've ultimately run out comfortable winners after 90 minutes over recent seasons, they never fail to give us a bit of a shake.

Looking at the forecast, the biggest enemy is going to be the weather, so keep your fingers crossed we can get this game on and progress into the next round of the Scottish Cup.
