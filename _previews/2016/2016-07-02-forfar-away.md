It's the first chance to see the squad together under Grant Munro and the new management team as Brora travel to Station Park to meet The Loons on their home turf.

Forfar slipped down into the Ladbrokes League 2 for the coming season, joining fellow Angus clubs Arbroath and Montrose, newly promoted Edinburgh City and our old Highland League competitors, Elgin City.

It's a fantastic pre season fixture for both clubs. Last season was a hard fought affair for the top 3 in the Highland League and Stuart and the lads will be keen to get some competitive football under their belts before our opening game against Nairn on the 30th July, and especially the following Wednesday for the 1st Round of the IRN-BRU Cup.

Forfar Athletic will be looking for a good start to their season too as Gary Bollan looks to knit his new signings into the squad.
