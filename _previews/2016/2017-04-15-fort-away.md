It's the final League fixture of the season for Brora Rangers, and the travelling support are rewarded with a trip to Fort William.

The journey along the A82 comes as a welcome change to trips along the A96 every season, to say nothing of the customary stop at Fort Augustus and a bag of chips aside the Caledonian Canal.

There is little else we can do for this game but play for the 3 points, finish our season with 81 points, and wait to see what happens with Buckie and Cove's remaining fixtures. Those who have followed the Cattachs home and away since we started this campaign back in July will possibly be more focused on what awaits us next season since Ross took the helm, as there definitely seems to be an air of expectation more akin to our 2nd League title winning season around Dudgeon Park since then.

But Fort William is a fine place to visit for our final game, come along, join the party ... but remember to keep something in reserve for our North of Scotland Cup Quarter Final against Nairn on the 29th.

**See you there**
