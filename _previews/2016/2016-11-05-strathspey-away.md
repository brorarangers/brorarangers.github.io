We are off on our travels again this weekend, to the lovely Grantown on Spey.

Strathspey Thistle are currently sitting 2nd bottom of the Highland Football League table 30 points behind us, but if there is one thing we've taken away from our recent fixtures (apart from 3 points) it is the Strathy Jags determination to play football for 90 minutes.

Strathspey Thistle signed Dominick Edwards, Stefan MacRitchie and Inaki Fernandino-Soto over the summer. With the 7 points they have already secured in the League this season they are a third of the way to beating their previous record total of 20 points last season, but with narrow losses to Fort William in September and Rothes last month at Seafield Park they will have to find a rich vein of form in their remaining fixtures.

Our last two trips to Seafield Park have seen us return with 0-7 and 1-6 victories, and with the fight for precious points at the opposite end of the table we will be looking for a repeat of these scorelines on Saturday. Whilst Cove sit a single point above us, with a lonely 1 goal advantage, League leaders Buckie's early scoring sprees sees them with a commanding goal difference of 53. Last season demonstrated all too painfully the importance Goal Difference can make come next April.

The Supporters Club are running a bus to the game, leaving Dudgeon Park at 11:00am, with pick ups along the route. If you fancy a great day out in fine company you could do worse than get in touch with them and book a seat.

It's a chance to see Cattach's new boy [Jamie Duff](/2016/11/01/brora-win-race-for-jamie-duff/). It's always good to see a new member of the Red Family get a warm welcome.
