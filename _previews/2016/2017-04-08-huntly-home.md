We have two home games to catch up on from earlier postponements coming up at Dudgeon Park, starting with the visit of Huntly this Saturday.

This game was originally scheduled for Hogmanay last year and the Black and Golds will now arrive with some impressive results under their belt since then, not least a February 3-3 draw against Formartine Utd and March's 1-0 defeat of Buckie Thistle. They are not a squad to be underestimated.

It's our last Saturday home League game of the 2016-17 season, and that 3rd League title is still within our grasp ... just. With Cove and Formartine facing each other in the final of the Breedon Highland League Cup we'll be keeping half an eye on proceedings at Victoria Park in Buckie, where Deveronvale attempt to so what only Cove, Huntly and ourselves have accomplished so far this season and take 3 points from the Jags. It's more than possible that this coming Wednesday will see the clashes that determine the outcome of the League though.

We have plenty to celebrate from our season, and you can vote for your [Players of the Year](/2017/04/03/awards-night/) at this game against Huntly, and join in the awards ceremony after the game in the Social Club.
