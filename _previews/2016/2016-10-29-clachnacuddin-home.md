Next up, it's near neighbours Clachnacuddin. Sitting 9th in the League, they are on a bit of a winning streak.

Last weekend they ran out 2-0 victors over Inverurie Loco Works, the previous Wednesday they took a point from the ever dangerous Turriff Utd. All in all, they have been unbeaten for 9 games.

They've claimed a few scalps this season, not least of which was a 2-2 draw against Cove Rangers last month. Food for thought indeed.

It was apparent very early in the season that this was going to be an extremely competitive League season. Clubs were going to spring surprises and complacency wins no titles. Clach followed their 2-2 draw with the current title holders with a similar scoreline against opposite end of the table Rothes. Srathspey Thistle currently have 2 wins to their name this season, one of them was at Grant St Park against Clach.

Clach boss Iain Polworth knows what he needs to do, he was quoted in [Thursday's Highland News](http://www.highland-news.co.uk/Sport/Football/Only-our-best-will-do-against-rampant-Brora-say-Polworth-25102016.htm) as saying

>"Our run was interrupted by the Scottish Cup break and, although we have been in decent form, Brora are a different class to the teams we have been playing and I donâ€™t mean any disrespect to those teams."

>"Brora are probably the best team in the league ... This will be the ultimate test for us"

>"Like we do in any game, we hope to limit their chances, but also try to make an impact at the other end. We were well beaten against Brora last year and we will have to be at our best again this weekend."

"Well beaten" is a bit of an understatement, it was a festive massacre to cheer the travelling Cattachs, but games like that don't come along often, whether you are the victor or the vanquished. Given Clach's current run, there is nothing we can take for granted.
