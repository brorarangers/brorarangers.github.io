Right, hands up all those that remember the last time Nairn came to Dudgeon Park, you know, the game where we all expected a predictable if tight victory?

January 2016, it was tight at the top of the League, and the 3 points against Nairn were vital. Vital but unobtainable that day. We went on to meet Nairn again before the season was over in the final of the League Cup. 

Few would describe that as the most exciting game of football ever witnessed, but we really cancelled each other out that weekend, and the penalty shoot out saw the Cup come to the Dudgeon for the first time.

We started our League campaign against the Wee County this season with a [0-4 away win](/2016/07/30/nairn-away-report/). We took our chances against what we recognised as an inexperienced Nairn squad. Inexperienced then perhaps, first game of the season and little time for pre-season preparation. Time moves on.

Since then Nairn County have taken 3 points away from a trip to Keith, a point away from the ever tricky Broch, and in what was possibly the most value for money game of the first weekend of November, 3 points from a trip to Huntly.

It's been a stern test for the Nairn support and all those who put in the work behind the scenes that all involved with Highland Football League football are well aware of. Sitting 13th in the League and rebuilding a Club based on community spirit they have plenty to celebrate already.

We, however, carry on with our November theme of [making hay](/2016/10/29/remember-remember/). We can't avoid any slip ups, and we don't expect to. We say that every week. It's football ... nothing is guaranteed. Why else would we all keep turning up?

We are forecasting a pretty chilly afternoon weather wise on Saturday, chilly outside, anything but on the pitch. Nairn set out their stall to defend on the opening game of the season, but they've grown in confidence since then. We are on a hunt for goals and clean sheets throughout November to keep our place at the head of the table. 

We have little confidence in Nairn County complying with our game plan. We have every confidence in the Brora squad complying with ours.

There are still some spaces in our main hospitality and Board Room hospitality plans. Fancy making the weekend a wee bit bit special? Contact [Russell](mailto: russell.jaffrey@btinternet.com) or [David](david@cairngormgroup.co.uk) and we will sort out the perfect Saturday afternoon experience for you.
