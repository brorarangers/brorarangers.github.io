It's the North of Scotland Cup semi final matches this weekend, and Brora Rangers host Forres Mechanics at Dudgeon Park.

Forres scored a last minute winner in the opening round to earn a quarter final fixture against Halkirk Utd last weekend. Their 0-3 victory at Morrison Park set them up for our meeting this weekend.

Meanwhile, over at Mackessack Park, Rothes will face Fort William in the other semi final in what promises to be an extremely tightly contested affair.

**The weather forecast is looking fantastic for this game, so let's see you at Dudgeon Park on Saturday afternoon to roar the Cattachs into another Cup Final**
