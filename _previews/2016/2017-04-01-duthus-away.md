This weekend Brora Rangers take a break from Press and Journal Highland Football League business, and open our North of Scotland Cup campaign in Tain.

St Duthus FC formed only six years after ourselves, in 1885, and now compete in the North Caledonian League. They are no strangers to Cup success, as a look at the [brief history on their website](http://www.stduthusfc.co.uk/history.php) shows.

Brora first won the North of Scotland Cup back in 1980-81, and we've lifted it again on a further three occasions ... most recently in 2014-15. The disappointment of missing out on a League Cup Final spot to Cove Rangers could be offset somewhat with a good run in this competition and the opportunity to relieve our near neighbours and rivals, Wick Academy, of the trophy this season.

For Brora fans this has the feeling of a 'Super Saturday'. A Supporters team take on the 'Auldies' in Brora at midday, giving plenty of time to catch up with some of our stars of seasons gone by before heading down to Tain for the Cup tie. Niall Harkiss, St Duthus Chairman, promises a warm welcome for the travelling support and expects an entertaining game.

Don't tarry too long in Tain after the match however ... get yourselves back to Dudgeon Park Community Centre in time for Ronnie n Donnie taking the stage at 8pm for their usual night of singing, dancing and all round good entertainment.
