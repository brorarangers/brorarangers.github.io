We kick off our Festive games at Lossiemouth this Friday, weather permitting. It's an 8pm kick off, which may just help.

Waterlogged pitches have only scuppered a couple of games so far this season, and a cold snap in mid November saw several games in the east postponed due to frozen turf, but by and large the weather has been kind to Highland League football so far this season. Dire warnings in the Press suggest Storm Barbara may make conditions less than favourable for a game of football this weekend though.

It certainly isn't a game we want to see postponed. And poor weather at our pre Christmas match last year against Clachnacuddin certainly didn't appear to have an adverse effect on the Cattachs.

Lossie certainly sent out a warning message last weekend to anyone who thinks the 12th placed Club are going to be a pushover. Trailing 2-0 down at Harlaw Park with 15 minutes left, goals from Scott Miller and Martin Charlesworth saw the Coasters take a solid point home.

Lossie had a cracking start to their season and arrived at Dudgeon Park at the end of August unbeaten. A hat trick from Paul Brindle, a double from Cammy and goals from Zander and James Ross with no reply put an end to that run though.

Brora have certainly picked themselves up and dusted themselves down since a disappointing draw against Nairn County, a seat of the pants win over Strathspey and a sore defeat at home against Cove Rangers. It's a time of change at Dudgeon Park, and whilst that can be unsettling, the reaction of the coaching and playing staff has been fantastic, as ably demonstrated against Huntly and then Turriff.

Results elsewhere last weekend have done us no harm whatsoever and results over the Festive period will no doubt have a large bearing on the outcome of this season's competion.

The Supporters Club are organising a bus to Lossie if you want to get the Christmas celebrations off to a good start. Given the forecast, it is definitely worth keeping an eye on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/) pages closer to the weekend for any updates.
