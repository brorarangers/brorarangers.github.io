Wednesday sees us back in League action for another night under the lights. And what a night it promises to be.

We enter the second third of this season's League campaign with a table topping clash against an extremely free scoring Buckie Thistle. Free scoring as in 53 goals scored in their first 10 games.

Some games just feel bigger than others, some results just seem more important than others, and someone has to step up and halt the Buckie juggernaut before the season goes on much longer.

~~If Brora can be the first this season to deny The Jags their 3 points it will certainly help close the 5 point gap they currently command at the top of the table as well as set us up nicely for the rest of the month as we head towards our Scottish Cup 2nd Round game against Clyde.~~

*Inverurie Locos beat Brora to the honour of denying Buckie the full points on Saturday, and now it's up to the Jags to show how they respond to losing their air of invincibility. They'll need to show how they respond to suspensions and possible injuries too.*

Buckie have only conceded 2 League goals at home this season, and have kept clean sheets in 4 out of their 5 games at Victoria Park. However, Cove Rangers, Lossiemouth, Nairn County, Fort William, Rothes and Strathspey Thistle have all proved that getting goals is far from beyond our reach. The real battle is going to be controlling the Buckie front men. 

John McLeod is leading the League's Top Scorer list so far with 19 goals, followed by team mates Chris Angus and Sam Urquart with an impressive 23 goals between them. There is no doubt that we need to be on our toes to keep these lads under control.

It's not all about the Buckie however. We've scored 16 League goals away from home, and only Cove have managed to put more than one in our net whilst on our travels.

Let's face it, it's an important match for both Clubs. It's a game that we'll both be looking forward to, and the chances of a goalless draw are about as likely as the Brora support bypassing the Grant Arms on the way home from Pitmedden in a fortnight.

The weatherman promises yet another fine evening, it's an 8pm kickoff at Victoria Park, and we're expecting a big turnout. We'll leave the final word to our Chairman ...

>Whilst the Highland League title will be neither won nor lost on Wednesday evening, there is no denying that our match at Buckie on Wednesday will be crucial.
Midweek away games are never easy for players nor fans, but at least an 8pm kick-off makes logistics a little easier.
I'm over in France at present and cannot get back in time for the game, but can I thank in advance all the Brora supporters who will make the journey to Buckie to cheer on the boys.
I expect there will be a big turnout for the home team , so I know the Board, Committee and Players will be very grateful to supporters that can make the journey for the game.
