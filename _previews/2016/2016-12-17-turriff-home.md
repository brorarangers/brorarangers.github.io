We are expecting a tight contest this weekend as we welcome 5th placed Turriff Utd to Dudgeon Park.

We overcame Turriff by a single goal at The Haughs at the end of August, in a game which saw the return of Ross Tokely. Our [Match Report](/2016/08/27/turriff-away-report/) from that meeting recalls a Turriff side setting themselves up very defensively and Brora finally breaking them down in the 2nd half to earn the 3 points.

United's form on the road this season has been mixed; victories at Princess Royal, Mosset, Christie, Harlaw and Mackessack Parks have been cancelled out by defeats to Buckie, Fort William, Keith, Lossiemouth and Wick, and a goalless draw against Clachnacuddin.

We need to go all the way back to January 2012 to find the last time Turriff Utd managed to leave Dudgeon Park with 3 points, but they demonstrated that we can take nothing for granted in October 2015 with a 1-1 draw thanks to a 53rd minute Nick Gray goal, a flurry of yellow cards, a sending off for Brora's Colin Williamson, and a 78th minute equaliser from a Richie Brittain free kick.

Meanwhile Cove Rangers head to face Fraserburgh, their bogey team last season, and Buckie face an unpredictable Forres Mechanics. This could be a weekend for change at the top of the table ...

It's our last home game before Christmas and our Hospitality is fully booked, but we've still got spaces for our Hogmanay fixture against Huntly if you want to get in touch with [Russell](mailto: russell.jaffrey@btinternet.com) or [David](david@cairngormgroup.co.uk) to book a table for the end of the year.
