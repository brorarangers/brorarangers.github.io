Next up for the Cattachs is a trip to soon to be BBC Alba stars, Turriff Utd. 

Turra couldn't be more 'mid-table' going into this game - played 4, won 2, lost 2 and a goal difference of 0. Victims of the early League form of Lossiemouth and Wick Academy they will be keen to keep their winning home record.

However, the Brora squad showed last weekend that the fast, fluent and inventive football that they can deliver is back on the menu.

Training sessions this week have gone well despite a few players carrying knocks and, as usual, competition is fierce for a starting place for what will be an important match for both sides.

The Supporters Club are running a bus to this game, leaving Dudgeon Park at 10:00, grab your seat on their Facebook page.

Turriff Utd have proven stern opponents over the past few seasons, those who were at The Haughs back in January will no doubt remember the unrestrained joy of Grant Munro as he sealed a victory with our 3rd goal. We are all looking forward to his celebrations in his new role as Manager.
