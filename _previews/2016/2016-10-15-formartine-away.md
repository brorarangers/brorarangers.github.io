It's back to Pitmedden next weekend for the Cattachs for what has become one of the most exciting meetings in recent seasons.

When we say 'exciting', we mean edge of your seat exciting. For example, our League Cup quarter final back in March. After handing out a 5-0 skelping to Formartine Utd on their home turf the previous season, they came to Dudgeon Park in the first few weeks of last season and returned the compliment with a 2-0 victory and 3 points leaving on the bus east.

It pretty much set the scene for our League Cup visit. The vidiprinter that afternoon ran pretty much as follows:

*15:19 Formartine Utd 0-1 Brora Rangers (Brindle)*

*15:32 Formartine Utd 1-1 Brora Rangers (Rodger)*

*15:40 Formartine Utd 1-2 Brora Rangers (Williamson)*

*15:44 Formartine Utd 1-3 Brora Rangers (Maclean)*

At this stage, teletext viewers in the Sutherland broadcasting area also received an additional message along the lines of ...

*15:45 Ya Beauty, that's it, we're off to the Semi Final.*


For the rest of the country, coverage continued as normal ...


*16:08 Formartine Utd 2-3 Brora Rangers (Anderson)*

*16:11 Formartine Utd 3-3 Brora Rangers (Wood)*

*16:14 Formartine Utd 4-3 Brora Rangers (Lawson)*

*16:26 Formartine Utd 5-3 Brora Rangers (Barbour)*

*16:27 Formartine Utd 5-4 Brora Rangers (Greig)*

*16:51 Formartine Utd 5-5 Brora Rangers (Brindle)*

*FULL TIME - Extra Time to be played*

*17:05 Joe Malin forced to leave the field of play through injury ... all Brora substitutes used ... striker John MacLeod dons the No1 shirt and gloves.*

*17:15 Half Time in Extra time: Formartine Utd 5-5 Brora Rangers*

*17:30 Full Time: Formartine Utd 5-5 Brora Rangers ... time for penalties!*

John MacLeod saves Formartine's 4th penalty, Dale Gillespie scores for the Cattachs, and the rest, as they say, is history.

Our next meeting later in the same month, again at North Lodge Park, resulted in a 3-3 draw. Formartine dominated the first half and went in at the break 2-0 up. A change of personnel saw Brora run riot and draw level only for Wood to put the home side back in front against the run of play. In the last 15 minutes Steven Mackay put us back on level terms, and so another Battle Royale was completed between the two sides.

A match Preview should really look forward, and with our recent meetings to look back on we expect next weekend's game to bring similar levels of excitement and entertainment.

We go into this match 3 points ahead of Formartine Utd, but they in turn have a game in hand over us. Wick took the honours at NLP earlier this season whilst we've chalked up our first win of the season over our northern neighbours. Formartine have just taken all 3 points from the Locos, which we failed to manage.

There really is nothing in it, apart from the desire for 3 points and the need to keep firmly on the heels of Cove and Buckie. And that goes for both sides too.

... and our forecast? So far the weatherman says 'bright and sunny'. However, we predict no thaw between the two squads, a hail of goals and another whirlwind of a match.

**See you there**
