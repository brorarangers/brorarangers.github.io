It's mid September and Brora Rangers take to the road once again as we attempt to put a winning streak together ahead of some challenging and important fixtures over the next couple of weeks.

A well fought mid-week win at Harmsworth Park was exactly the response we needed after a disappointing draw last weekend, and this is exactly the right time to begin gathering momentum ahead of our Scottish Cup 1st Round tie at Fort William and an October fixture list that sees us finally come head to head with Buckie Thistle. Throw Fraserburgh, Formartine and hopefully another Scottish Cup game into the mix before Hallowe'en and the lads have a busy month ahead.

Our last game against the Vale was our final game of the 2015-16 season. Scott Fraser opened the scoring in the 20th minute for them and it took another goal from the Deveronvale skipper on the hour mark, this time into his own net, to spark the Brora lads back into action and see Scott Graham score his last goal for the Cattach's and see the 3 points stay at Dudgeon Park.

This weekend is no end of season fare though, and the 3 points could prove far more vital.
