Next up in the Press and Journal Highland League for Brora Rangers is 12th placed Keith.

Bouncebackability - it's in the Oxford English Dictionary. It's in the DNA of winners. It's in the Dudgeon Park dressing room.

After a disappointing loss at Buckie in midweek, it doesn't do any harm to take a quick glance back to a game against Keith on the 5th March 2014. We still had 5 games to play in the 2013-14 League season, but a 0-3 victory at Kynoch Park confirmed our first League title.

Amongst the squad playing for us that day were Joe Malin, Colin Williamson, Ross Tokely, Grant Munro, Gavin Morrison, Steven Ross, Dale Gillespie, Zander Sutherland, Andrew Greig, James Ross and Martin Maclean. We'll let you draw your own conclusions on the ability of those who appear on the team sheet for the Cattach's this weekend.

Past glories are great, they are what helps bond a Club and it's support together for life. But too much looking over your shoulder prevents you looking at what lies ahead. Grant and the lads won't have forgotten March 2014, neither will they have disregarded Wednesday night at Victoria Park, but Saturday is a new day.

There's an often trotted out phrase, 'You are only as good as your last result'. Not in this game. Not at all. We strive to be better than our last result. We strive to be as good as our *next* result.

So, down to the nitty gritty, Keith come into this game with a couple of creditable wins this season, not least against a Lossiemouth side who had previously taken 3 points from Turriff, Wick, Inverurie and Fraserburgh. Balancing that result though against losses against Nairn, Rothes and Huntly explains their spot in the bottom half of the League.

So whilst Keith will be looking forward to a new day, and reminding themselves they can perform against some very tough sides this season, the Brora management and playing squad will surely feel they have more to prove.

Incredibly, the weatherman tells us this fantastic spell of weather is to continue over the weekend, so the winter spectator gear isn't required yet.

Finally, as a last acknowledgement to the events of Wednesday's defeat at Victoria Park, we'd like to officially acknowledge our appreciation of those who made the massive commitment to travel through to Buckie on a Wednesday evening and face the long trip home again before work and school beckons all too soon the following day. Those present will testify to how the presence of a large and vocal home support appeared to spur the Buckie squad into running that extra yard longer, quicker and with the greater confidence of a positive outcome.

Let's give Brora Rangers that added spark this weekend, after all, it certainly worked to our advantage in March 2014, this season need be no different.
