Brora Rangers kick of the 2016/17 season with a visit to Nairn County's Station Park.

Competition between the two teams was fierce last season with a comprehensive victory for the Cattachs at this fixture, a well orchestrated victory for Nairn at Dudgeon Park and a League Cup final that required penalties to separate the two.

It's the start of a new era for Nairn County with huge changes within the Board and Committee along with the usual changes within any playing squad that occur over the close season. We've made our own changes too, and Grant and his team will be all too aware of how important a strong start to the season is for any club aspiring to claim the title in April 2017.
