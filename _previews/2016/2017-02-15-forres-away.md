It's yet another fixture that has the makings of an exciting meeting between two sides who are putting together some impressive results.

Whilst we swept Inverurie Loco Works aside on Saturday to progress in the League Cup, Forress played out a game reminiscent of our Quarter and Semi Finals last season. At one stage trailing 4-1 to the current League leaders, and down to 10 men, the Mighty Cans came back to finish 4-4 and eventually stole victory in a penalty shootout.

Currently sitting 7th in the League, Forres are certainly not a side to be underestimated at present.

However, those who have watched the Brora squad in their recent games against Buckie and Inverurie Locos can't fail to have noticed that Ross Tokely and John Docherty have rekindled a spark we always knew was there.

8 goals from 7 players, and a defence that helped the young Ross Munro to his first clean sheet on Saturday.

Everything points to a great evening of extremely competitve football.
