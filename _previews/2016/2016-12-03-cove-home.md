With 6 points separating Cove Rangers and ourselves, and Cove's 3 games in hand as we head into Saturdays meeting, it's the Game du Jour.

Cove Rangers come into this game on the back of a 3-0 victory over Inverurie Locos at the weekend, and haven't dropped a League point since a 2-2 draw against Clachnacuddin in mid September.
