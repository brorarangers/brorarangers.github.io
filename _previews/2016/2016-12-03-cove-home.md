With 6 points separating Cove Rangers and ourselves, and Cove's 3 games in hand as we head into Saturday's meeting, it's the Game du Jour.

Cove Rangers come into this game on the back of a 3-0 victory over Inverurie Locos at the weekend, and haven't dropped a League point since mid September.

A victory for Brora Rangers will see us both sitting in the League with 2 Defeats, 2 Losses and keeps us comfortably in the driving seat as we head into the Festive period. Anything less and we will find ourselves wriggling uncomfortably in the passenger seat reliant on favours from others for at least a while.

[Cove took the bragging rights](/2016/08/13/cove-away-report/) back in August when they ran out 2-1 winners against us at Harlaw Park. After the match Grant Munro stated

> “Cove looked hungrier and it’s in matches like these that you need to raise your game, and we didn’t."

With little to separate us on paper, it is likely that the result of Saturday's match will come down to who wants it most - but this time we have home advantage.

There is little room for error for those wishing to lift the League title at the end of this season. Points can not be squandered and this meeting is the classic 6 pointer for us. It is a game to make home advantage count.

It's your opportunity to make the difference. This is not the weekend for Christmas shopping. This is a weekend to rally the Red Army and keep Brora Rangers in the driving seat.
