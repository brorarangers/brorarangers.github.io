Brora Rangers continue their defence of the Breedon Highland League Cup this Saturday as we head east to Huntly.

After handing Inverurie Locos their biggest defeat since joining the Senior ranks in the opening round of the competition, confidence will be high as the squad make their way along the A96.

However, Huntly will also feel that the 1-6 defeat they suffered against us at Christie Park [last September](/2016/09/03/huntly-away-report/) will count for little having secured victory over Fraserburgh to reach the Quarter Final stage.

The Supporters Club have, as usual organised a bus for this game, leaving Dudgeon Park at 10.30am. If the photos on their Facebook page are anything to go by, the journey should be just as entertaining as the match.
