It’s Flag Day at Dudgeon Park again on Saturday the 1st of August. Brora welcome Rothes for our first home game of the season.

Ahead of the game Captain Steven Mackay said, “Rothes proved to be difficult to breakdown the last time they were here at the end of April. It’s a game that we must look to win and I know that the boys will be doing everything they can to ensure that we put in a solid performance. Its important to start the season as we mean to go on and send out a message to the other teams.”
