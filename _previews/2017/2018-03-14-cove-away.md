It's a big trip along the A96 for Brora Rangers as we meet Cove Rangers under the lights in our attempt to put an end to their unbeaten League campaign.

Fraserburgh and Rothes are the only sides to have taken any points from Cove Rangers so far this season, but Tokes and the lads will be aiming to gain more than a solitary point.

Cove last lost a match against Highland League opposition in November, when Formartine Utd won by a solitary goal to claim the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup. That leaves Falkirk as the only other club to get the better of The Toonsers this season ... so far.

Whilst John Sheeran's lads appear to be out of sight as far as winning the Press & Journal Highland League, we are still looking ahead to next season's Irn Bru and Scottish Cup campaigns. Points between now and the end of this season can very much mean prizes when Season 2018-19 rolls around.

We tend to sign off our match previews with a happy "**See you there**", but with the weather still refusing to acknowledge the onset of Spring and games and venues still requiring some very last minute changes to help all Clubs fulfill our fixture lists, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) channel will advise of any changes to the expected venue of Inverurie's Harlaw Park. In the meantime ...

**See you somewhere**
