It's a trip to Mackessack Park for the Brora Rangers this Saturday as focus on the final games of the 2017-18 League season.

This fixture has provided a barrelful of goals for the Brora squad in the past couple of seasons and some memorable days out for the supporters.

However, the Rothes of 2017-18 have already amassed more wins than they gained over the past 3 seasons combined and sit right slap bang in the middle of the League table.

A 2-0 victory over Inverurie Locos back in August shows The Speysiders are capable of taking some big scalps.
