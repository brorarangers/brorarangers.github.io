We are not entirely oblivious to the fact that some of our pre season meetings are bound to cause a degree of split loyalty amongst our support - and we expect this to be a tough test for a fair few of you.

2016-17 was quite a season for The Dons. An absolutely dominant Celtic were the only team Aberdeen failed to record a victory against for the whole of their League campaign; a League Cup Final appearance, again foiled by the Parkhead club, and finished the season with a Scottish Cup Final ... against Celtic ... again.

It's the second of our [Season Ticket Taster](/2017/06/05/season-ticket-taster/) matches, and we are billing this one as **The Battle of the Reds**.

Can Ross Tokely get the Brora squad up to speed this early in the month? What has Derek McInnes got up his sleeve to go one better in all competitions in 2017-18?

There is only one way you are going to find out. 3pm, 8th July 2017, Dudgeon Park ... **Get Red(dy)**
