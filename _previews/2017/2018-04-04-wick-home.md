Back at the end of January we met Inverurie Loco Works in the first round of the Highland League Cup. High winds saw the match abandoned within minutes.

The forced rescheduling of this tie saw our intended home game against Wick Academy postponed ... but this Wednesday evening it should be 'Game On'!

Brora head into the North Derby having won our last 3 League games by the goal against Keith, Nairn County and Turriff Utd. It has been enough to see us climb back up to 6th place as we catch up with our games in hand over the leading pack.

Whilst Wick currently sit back 2th place, they have had a fine run of form recently, including a 1-1 away draw against League Leaders, Cove Rangers.

We took the 3 points home from Harmsworth Park in an end to end affair back in October thanks to goals from Martin Maclean, Paul Brindle and a 75th minute penalty from Scott Graham.

This Wednesday evening match under the lights promises to be no less exciting.

**See you there**
