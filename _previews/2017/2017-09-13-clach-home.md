Clachnacuddin were last at Dudgeon Park only 3 short weeks ago where they caught us on the rebound from a disappointing defeat at the hands of the Locos.

This week they face us on League business on the back of a pleasing performance against Buckie Thistle as the Brora ship appears to have steadied.
