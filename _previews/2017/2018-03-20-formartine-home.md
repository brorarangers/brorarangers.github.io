Tuesday night sees Brora Rangers meet Formartine Utd in the semi final of the Breedon Highland League Cup at Dudgeon Park.

With the wintery weather finally seeming to have loosened it's grip on Brora it seems like this could be a mid week match well orth turning up to watch.

Formartine Utd last visited Dudgeon Park in October and handed out a painful 0-5 spanking which the lads will be keen to make ammends for.

Our League trip to Pitmedden last month showed a greatly improved performance where Brora Rangers played most of the game with 10 men after the dismissal of Gavin Morrison. Indeed it took two goals in the final 10 minutes for Utd to take advantage of tired legs and win the 3 points.

Fixtures between the two clubs rarely disappoint, and we will both be extremely keen to give ourselves a chance of winning this trophy this season.

Whilst we already have our hands on North of Scotland FA cup, Formartine are in the same situation after beating Cove Rangers to lift the Aberdeenshre Cup. When the chance of winning the League Championship has undoubtedly slipped away, the thought of winning the other 2 main trophies on offer becomes all the sweeter.

There is something to savour about mid week fixtures at this time of year, something special about a match under the floodlights ... and could definitely be to our advantage. A Tuesday night can be less than convenient for the travelling fans, less so for those who have less distance to travel to urge on their home team.

It's the League Cup Semi Final, it could be our chance to get our name on this trophy for the second time in the space of 3 seasons. It is definitely a night to wrap up and be part of the incredible Red Army that has supported us so well in all our Cup campaigns so far this season.
