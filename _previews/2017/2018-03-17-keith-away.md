This weekend Brora Rangers travel to Keith for the Breedon Highland League Cup Quarter Final, with a Semi Final place against Formartine Utd on Tuesday evening at stake.

We head into this match after a narrow defeat to Cove Rangers mid week, and a 3 goal League victory over Keith last weekend. We assume it will be showing no disrespect to class The Maroons as the underdogs for this match. However, if we've learned one thing in Cup competitions this season, it is never to underestimate the underdog.

Just ask Stranraer and East Fife.

Keith have a fine pedigree in this competition, winning the trophy 10 times in it's history, with their last victory back in 2012-13. That's twice as often as any of the Highland League clubs apart from Buckie Thistle and Forres Mechanics.

We first got our name on the cup back in 2015-16 after a penalty shoot out with Nairn County. It's fair to say we'd like to see our name back on it again this season.

The weather forecast for Kynoch Park over the remainder of the week is for gusty winds, rain and sleet, but Saturday looks like a far better day for a game of football.

Saturday 17th March, Kynoch Park, 3pm.
