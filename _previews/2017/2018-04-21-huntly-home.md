It's our last home game of the 2017-18 season, and fittingly it brings us almost full circle in our League campaign.

After losing their opening league match of the season to Cove Rangers, Huntly definitely took a scalp when they beat us 1-0 at Christie Park in early August.

A win for Huntly on Saturday can see them overtake Buckie Thistle.

A win for Brora will make little difference to our final league position, but could cement the place in the team for some of our younger players ahead of next season.
