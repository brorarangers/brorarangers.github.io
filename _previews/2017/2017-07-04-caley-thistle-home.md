It's the first of our Season Ticket Taster matches as we welcome Inverness Caledonian Thistle back to Dudgeon Park.

It is difficult to resist the temptation to draw parallels between our two Clubs as we head into this pre season meeting. Even at this stage, before a ball is kicked in a truly competitive match, this is a meeting of two clubs who are firmly focused on gaining promotion at the conclusion of the season.

Caley Thistle will soon be fighting it out with, amongst others, Dundee Utd, Falkirk and Dunfermline Athletic to regain entry to top flight Scottish football. It is only the second time the Inverness Club has felt the pressures of relegation, and they bounced straight back in the 2009-10 season. We certainly wish them success in carrying out a similar feat over the next 9 months.

Whilst Owain Fon-Williams, Ryan Esson, David Raven, Gary Warren, Ross Draper, Iain Vigurs, Liam Polworth, Scott Boden, Aaron Doran, Jake Mulranney, Brad McKay and Carl Tremarco have all committed to remaining at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium to fight for the return to the Premiership, we can expect to see some new faces on the evening of the 4th, not least in the dugout following the departure of Richie Foran.
