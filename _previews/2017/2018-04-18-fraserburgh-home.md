For fans of midweek football at Dudgeon Park, this is your last chance for a Wednesday night under the lights this season.

A look back through the League table as it developed throughout the season shows Fraserburgh rarely out of the top 3 for most of the season. But April hasn't been a good month for the Broch.

Defeats against Formartine Utd, Wick Academy, Cove Rangers and, on Saturday, Nairn County, has seen them tumble to 5th place. With only 4 games left until the end of their season they'll be looking to get back to winning ways.

The Brora squad showed on Saturday that they aren't ready to down tools and coast to the end of the season yet though, and we'll be looking to capitalise on the Broch's recent loss of form. A strong finish to the end of the season could still see us nick 5th place.

After the sustained period of disruptive weather since the start of the year, spring seems to have sprung in the North, and the weatherman assures us Wednesday evening will be a fine time for a game of footy.

**See you there**
