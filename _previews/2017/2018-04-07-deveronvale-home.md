Last season Deveronvale managed only 9 wins when the League came to it's conclusion. So far this season Steve Dolan's lads have fought their way to 10th in the table with 13 wins.

Vale were the visitors for Ross Tokely's first game in charge at Dudgeon Park back in January 2017, running out [6-2 winners](/2017/01/21/deveronvale-home-report/). That game was also the debut for young Kyle Macleod who opened his account in the red of Brora with two well taken goals.

At this stage of the season nothing is a 'given', and whilst another 6-2 win would do very nicely, thank you very much, we wouldn't advise betting the house on it.

As we head into the rest of April's Saturday - Wednesday - Saturday fixtures to [wrap up the 2017-18 season](/fixtures/) it is obvious we need to put together a strong performance on Saturday to give us some confidence and momentum as we travel to Harlaw Park on Wednesday, host Cove Rangers the following Saturday and then see Fraserburgh visit on Wednesday 18th.

It's a tough run of games, but with 24 points still available to us, it certainly isn't time to switch off just yet.

The weather forecasters tell us temperatures are set to rise this weekend (at last), and Saturday afternoon is definitely time for the Brora Rangers squad to turn up the heat.

**See you there**
