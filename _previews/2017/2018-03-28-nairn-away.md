This Wednesday sees Brora Rangers travel to Station Park to meet 11th placed Nairn County in a much needed League fixture.

The Wee County lie only 6 points behind Brora before kick off with a home record that reads 6 wins, 6 losses and a solitary draw.

In a month where the League has been forced to arrange Saturday, Wednesday and even a Tuesday evening match incredibly this will be only our 3rd League fixture in March, following on from a close defeat to Champions Elect, Cove Rangers, and a comfortable 3-0 win against Keith.

Nairn County were on the wrong end of a 4-1 score against Inverurie Locos last weekend, and a narrow 1-2 defeat against Formartine Utd the previous Saturday.

In our quest to secure a place in the Irn Bru Cup next season, there is very little room for slip ups in our remaining 11 League fixtures. Weather permitting, our fight back up the table starts at Station Park.

**See you there**
