It's our penultimate game of the season, and we are off to visit the Jags at Seafield Park.

Strathspey Thistle will be looking to get their 5th win of the season in their final game, a result which would lift them above Lossiemouth at the foot of table.

For ourselves nothing can change as far as our League position goes, and this is very much another chance for the Brora management team to assess players ahead of next season.

Showers are forecast again, but we don't expect that to dampen the enthusiasm of the Grantown lads. So get yourselves along to Seafield Park this Saturday to back the Cattachs as the season draws to a close.
