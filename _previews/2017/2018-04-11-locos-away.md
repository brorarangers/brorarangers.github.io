It's a mid week trip to Inverurie this Wednesday on League business. Somehow the fact it's the League seems to make a difference.

Our recent Cup history against the Locos makes for happy reading and progression to the next round ... but this is League business, and that seems to make things tougher.

Despite emphatic back to back victories in the Highland League Cup over the North East outfit over the past few seasons, we need to go back to October 2015 for our last League win.

The inevitable combination of injuries and suspensions at this stage of the season has forced Ross to reshuffle the squad, but that seemed to do us no harm on Saturday against Deveronvale at the weekend.

This Wednesday is the perfect opportunity for lads like Scott Lisle, Kyle Macleod and Craig Campbell to fight their way into starting line ups for the rest of this season and beyond.

For those planning to make the trek along the A96 from Brora on Wednesday evening, we salute you. Those Cattachs based closer to the shadow of Bennachie, get yourselves along to Harlaw Park for the 8pm kick off and make some noise!

**See you there**
