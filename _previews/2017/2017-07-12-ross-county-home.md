It's our the last of our Season Ticket Taster pre season matches with our one time Highland League rivals, and now Premership Club, Ross County making the short trip North.

Jim McIntyre led the Staggies to a 7th place finish last season. Not too shabby, as they say.

Probably of more note to Brora fans is the achievement of Steven Ferguson and Stuart Kettlewell in winning the Development League title. Rivalries take a long, long time to disappear in football, and bridge different Leagues with no difficulty at all. It's not that long ago since a victory over our Dingwall neighbours was the sweetest of results. But it would take the most curmudgeonly of viewpoints to deny that this is a fantastic achievement for Ross County.

We well understand the constraints that beset anyone running a football club in the North of Scotland, not least of which is geographical ... a smaller population, and distance from the Central Belt brings it problems. A quality Youth Development Programme on our doorstep is a huge benefit to North football. [Ross Munro](/2016/12/31/no-dudgeon-doldrums/) was certainly all the proof you should need of that, given his performances throughout his loan spell last season as he deputised for an injured Joe Malin.
