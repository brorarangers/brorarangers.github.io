Goal,Joe,Malin,6,0,6,1,2,3,0,0,"Joe was the Supporters Player of the Year in our first League Championship winning season. Last season he managed the incredible feat of only conceding 13 League goals ... unlucky for some, maybe, but certainly not for Brora.","Joe signed in July '13 and has been ever present between the sticks since then. Hero of penalty shoot-outs and often the man who has secured the points in important games, Sometimes in football the buck stops with the Goalie. And Joe stops.",No,Liam Mackenzie & David Dowling

Defence,John,Pickles,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"John signed at the start of this season from Orkney side Rendall FC.

Defence,Ally,Macdonald,4,2,6,0,0,0,0,0,"Ally is another face we'd seen in red at Dudgeon Park. Always keen to get forward, fans have been delighted to see Ally sign a new contract","Having returned from the US, Ally put pen to paper again for Brora in August. ",No,Shaun Carrison
Defence,Colin,Williamson,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,"Colin joined us at the start of 2014 and quickly established himself as a fearless member of the back four. A broken collarbone saw Colin miss much of the end of our second League Championship, but a full recovery sees him as an ever present member of the starting 11.",Colin arrived in January 2014 ... and has lived up to the reputation he built for himself at Clachnacuddin. Quick to snuff out threats from the opposition and just as quick to snatch the opportunity to score some vital goals throughout last season.,No,Rossy & Carl
