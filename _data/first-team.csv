Goal,Joe,Malin,7,0,7,1,2,3,0,0,"Joe was the Supporters Player of the Year in our first League Championship winning season and picked up the Players Player of the Year for our second. Last season he managed the incredible feat of only conceding 13 League goals ... unlucky for some, maybe, but certainly not for Brora.","Joe signed in July '13 and has been ever present between the sticks since then. Hero of penalty shoot-outs and often the man who has secured the points in important games, Sometimes in football the buck stops with the Goalie. And Joe stops.",No,Liam Mackenzie & David Dowling

Defence,Colin,Williamson,7,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,"Colin joined us at the start of 2014 and quickly established himself as a fearless member of the back four. A broken collarbone saw Colin miss much of the end of our second League Championship, but a full recovery sees him as an ever present member of the starting 11.",Colin arrived in January 2014 ... and has lived up to the reputation he built for himself at Clachnacuddin. Quick to snuff out threats from the opposition and just as quick to snatch the opportunity to score some vital goals throughout last season.,No,Rossy & Carl
Defence,Grant,Munro,6,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,"Grant's experience over the past 2 seasons was invaluable in the recent success of Brora Rangers.

Defence,Scott,Houston,6,0,6,0,0,0,2,0,"Scott joined us in February 2013, signing from Muir of Ord Rovers.

Signed from Clachnacuddin over the summer, Paul's hunger for goals and quickness to settle in to his new side saw him get on the score sheet in his first League game.",Signing on the same day as Richard Brittain probably pushed Paul somewhat down the headlines back at the start of June. Since then Paul has let his playing do the talking and is definitely headline news with supporters.,No,Adrian Boyle
