As we get ready for our Cup Final weekend we continue to ponder what we would do if we were to win the Cattachs Lotto before the end of the year.

The [trip to El Clasico](/2017/10/29/cattachs-lotto/) has been postponed in preference for a trip to Forres, and the Supporters Club have missed out on [their own transport](/2017/10/30/lotto-spending-spree/), but despite having won nothing yet, the **£7,250.00** Jackpot continues to burn a hole in our pocket.
