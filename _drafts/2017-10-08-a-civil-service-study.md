Back in February 2015 the Liverpool Echo published an article listing what they felt were the 12 strangest named football clubs in the world.

Sitting neatly between Ghana's Mysterious Dwarves FC and King Faisal Babes FC are the Scottish Lowland League's very own Civil Service Strollers.

Despite some of the less 'family friendly' club names mentioned (hence the lack of a link ... but Google is your friend) we are sure that Eritrea Shoe Factory FC and Botswana Meat Commision FC can't have the history of their club names very far removed from the roots of our own Inverurie Loco Works or Forres Mechanics.

Founded in 1908 as Edinburgh Civil Service Football Club, the Strollers moved from Stenhouse Stadium to Pinkhill Stadium, and then on to their current home at the Edinburgh Civil Service Sports Association in Muirhouse.

As far as we can see, the 2-1 victory over Strathspey Thistle at the end of last month was the Edinburgh club's first Scottish Cup win against Highland League opposition. Fraserburgh, Forres and Turriff Utd have all put them out of the competition in previous seasons.

Not that past campaigns can lull us into any false sense of security. Having joined the Lowland League only last season, the Strollers are definitely on form. To follow their Scottish Cup win they have since been the first team in the Lowland League to take 3 points away from BSC Glasgow with a 4-2 win at Christie Gillies Park on Saturday.
