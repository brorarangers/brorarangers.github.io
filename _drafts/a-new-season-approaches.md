Who is the most important member of your football club? We have an incredibly hard working Baord and Committee at Brora Rangers FC.

We believe we have put together, under Ross Tokely, a squad to deliver us the League title for a third time ... our plans are important, our management team are important, our squad is important.

Looking beyond our points total at the end of the season, looking beyond a Cup or two sitting in our trophy cabinet, who really brings a football club to life?

It is obviously our support. The lads and lassies who turn up week in, week out, the lads and lassies who can't imagine missing a game at Dudgeon Park, the lads and lassies who jump on the Supporters Bus at every opportunity to travel around the Highland League territory.

And we think Wille Huggan is a perfect example to start a series of posts about our fans ... you want inspirational? Meet Willie.

As the first of our spotlighlights on a Cattach it would be great to report that Willie was one of a kind, he may well be, but not to us. To us, Willie is just 'one of us'

We like that at Dudgeon Park, folk with a common dream. Folk who believe come Hell or High Water, we will progress. We have them, whether it is the Board, the Committee, our Hall of Fame members, or Willie and his ilk. We have them.
