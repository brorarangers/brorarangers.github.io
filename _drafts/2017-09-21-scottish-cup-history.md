Let's not get carried away with the headline here. This is not a history of the competition behind the oldest national trophy in the world.

It isn't even a complete history of Brora Rangers involvement in the tournament. It is, however, a glance back at some of our recent Scottish Cup games.

We need to head back to September 2009 for our last fixture against an Ayrshire club in The Cup. Irvine Meadow came to Brora, left 0-2 victors, made the next trip to Selkirk, leaving 0-3 victors and then hosted Arbroath. The meeting on the 28th November 2009 was one of those headline creating matches as the Junior side knocked the then 2nd Division Angus club out of the competiton with a 1-0 victory, and booked themselves a 4th Round glamour tie with Hibs at Easter Road. That proved to be the end of the Cup journey with a 0-3 defeat ... but we'll take solace from that.

2010 saw us head down to Auld Reekie for a thrilling match against Edinburgh City. Trailing 0-1 at half time, a 58th minute goal from Nigel Mackenzie saw us right back in the hunt. A 90th minute goal from Mackay seemed to have sealed the victory for The Cattachs, until Antoni scored in injury time for the home side. 2-2, and a replay at Dudgeon Park the following week where we ran out 2-1 victors and headed east to old rivals Elgin City.

Two unanswered goals from a certain Craig Gunn in the first half put Brora firmly on the back foot. Elgin's third goal came in the 52nd minute, but a quick recovery saw Neil score in the 54th minute to give the visitors some much needed hope. Within 10 minutes Elgin had scored twice to make it 5-1. A late Red rally saw Brora score in the 83rd and 88th minute, ut it was too late, and Brora returned home on the wrong side of a 5-3 scoreline.

Defeat at the hands of Edinburgh City and Formartine in the next two seasons saw our Cup hopes dashed at the first hurdle, but the next two seasons were to be our most successful in the tournament so far.

An ill tempered meeting with Vale of Leithen, where the [William Hill highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXhK1uHeSB4) capture the 'oh so close' attempts and Sid's injury time winning goal, but miss the 4 red cards handed out to the Lowland League team as well as the dismissal of their manager. It's The Scottish Cup, it raises passions.

That match earned us a home tie with Highland League rivals, Cove Rangers. A first half Roy McBain goal was cancelled outby a Gavin Morrison strike in the 63rd minute, and there the scoring ended for the afternoon. The replay at Allan Park proved to be a smoother affair with unanswered goals from Zander, Sid and Martin Maclean leaving us with the feeling that this was going to be our season for a 'Big Cup Run'.

A trip to Cumbernauld in early November proved to be, frustratingly, a step too far. Despite Zander opening the scoring in the 3rd minute. Clyde's McCluskey levelled the scores 10 minutes later and then deadlock ensued. Substitute Kevin Watt came on for Clyde in the 73rd minute, and proceeded to score for the home side barely a minute later. It's a long trip home from Cumbernauld ...

We started our 2014/15 Scottish Cup campaign with a 2nd Round 5-0 victory over Banks O' Dee, followed by a nervy 2-3 away win over Edinburgh City with first half goals from Colin Williamson, Gavin Morrison and Chubbs. And that took us onwards to a 4th Round tie with Queen of the South who were putting up a serious challenge at the top of the SPFL Championship at the time.

If you want to play in National competitions and test yourselves against new opposition you're as well to go the whole hog and get a trip to the diagonally opposite corner of the country at the end of November and play a team who had already beaten Hibs and would follow our visit with a victory over Glasgow Rangers.

These were heady days. These were the days when anything was possible and the names of Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly held little fear.

Bed and Breakfasts were booked, travel arrangements discussed and a bus load of hardy souls made the day return trip from Dudgeon Park to Palmerston Park.

Dumfries forgot what kind of weather it was meant to supply as the last month of the year approached, and the unseasonal warmth allowed the town to be occupied by a small army of Brora supporters proudly displaying their Brora Rangers short sleeved replica kit as they soaked up the sun.

History records a 4-1 victory for the Doonhamers, memory recalls a match where goals from the aforementioned Lyle and Reilly didn't look like they'd be enough once Andrew Greig pulled one back in the 65th minute. Further goals from Russell and Kidd combined with the apparent lack of endurance between a Highland League squad and a Championship team proved too much ... but for a while, the dream was well and truly alive.

**Original Moments ... Outstanding Memories**

Defeats to Arbroath in 2015-16 and Clyde in 2016-17 made for far shorter Cup runs, but now it's 2017-18, and it all starts again. What better place to join us on this season's journey than right at the start?

**See you there**
