Brora Rangers moved 3 points clear at the head of the Press & Journal Highland League after a comfortable   6-2 victory over Keith on Saturday. 

Despite the very heavy overnight rain with parts of the Kynoch Park saturated, referee Dan McFarlane gave the go ahead to play after a 2pm second pitch inspection. The Keith ground staff had to add additional sand to parts of the surface and underfoot conditions during the game were to remain very  difficult. 

Speaking after the match Player Manager Richard Brittain paid tribute to his players as to how they handled conditions which deteriorated as the game progressed. 

"Every one out there today gave 100% plus against a quick skilful Keith side who chased every ball. We adapted our game as the ball was not travelling across the turf so tried to find our forwards over the top and these tactics worked very well" 

"The conditions took their toll with Gillespie, Morrison and Sutherland all suffering knocks and we took the decision to replace them with one eye on next week's game" 

Despite the dull skies the game started brightly with Keith creating a early chance, but Grant Munro defended well against a Luke Barbour shot. 

At the other end Brora were unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty when Zander Sutherland was bundled to the ground but referee McFarlane was having none of it. However in 6 minutes Sutherland was again floored in the box and this time the spot kick was given. Dale Gillespie stepped up to open the scoring with a conversion high to the keepers left. 

Brora quickly took control of the game with "Man of the Match" Martin Maclean controlling the middle of the park with his ball distribution faultless despite the wet conditions. 

Brora doubled their advantage in 28 minutes when a Gavin Morrison strike was diverted past Daniel Bell by John Macleod. Macleod collected his second in the 33rd minute to see the Cattachs take a comfortable lead into the half time break. 

The game was effectively ended as a contest within a minute of the restart when Martin Maclean added a fourth, a fitting reward for his endeavours. 

Although firmly on the back foot Keith were quick on the break and their endeavours were rewarded when Matthew MacDonald scored from close range after some neat build up play. 

Brora restored their four goal advantage when substitute Paul Brindle scored on his first game back following his injury against Arbroath in the Scottish Cup Tie. Brindle's overall performance will be encouraging for Brora as his pace can open up opposition defences and he came through his 30 minutes without any ill effect. 

Brora's 6th was added by Richard Brittain himself from the penalty spot in the 80th minute following the upending of Andrew Greig by Sam Pugh. Greig had been busy all afternoon and was a constant threat to the Keith defence. The penalty was due reward for his afternoon's shift wide on the left. 

Keith added a second in the final minutes of the game when Pugh poked in past Joe Malin,  but it was Brora who returned north with all three points and clear leaders of the league. 

This Saturday is the big one, when Brora entertain Cove Rangers at Dudgeon Park, who themselves are unbeaten in league assignments this year. This match is already being billed as a Championship decider and a large home support is anticipated for this crucial fixture. 

Richard Brittain said "He and his coaching team have been looking forward to this match and the team will working on their game plan at their training sessions in Dingwall midweek. Everybody is fully aware of the consequences of this game and are focused on winning. I hope the knocks we picked up today will be short lived, but we have a talented in-depth squad here and enter the game in excellent form and  with confidence levels high"
