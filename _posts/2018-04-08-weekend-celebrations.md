Back in June 2017 when the Scottish Highland Football League released the fixture list, this coming weekend was always earmarked for a party in Brora.

Last summer seems like a long, long time ago now - and the anticipation of a final match of the season decider against Cove Rangers is also long gone. The spell of weather Siberia sent our way means this weekend won't even be the final League fixture.

But it is still our weekend to party, as there is plenty to celebrate.

We kick the weekend off with our annual [Golf Day](/2018/02/17/golf-day-announced/) on Friday 13th. It's not too late to get a team together, get in touch with [Kevin](mailto: brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com) if you fancy a grand day out at a fantastic golf course.

Saturday sees the newly confirmed Scottish Highland Football League Champions, Cove Rangers, roll into town. At the time of writing Cove are as yet unbeaten in the League. Indeed they are on their way to beating some of the records we set back in our two League winning seasons ... something we'd obviously like to halt.

Win, lose or draw on Saturday, the final blow of the referees whistle signals the start of the party.

This is not a time for dwelling on frustrating games at the start of the season, League defeats that were as damaging as they were disappointing. This is a night for remembering an August [Tuesday evening at Starks Park](/2017/08/15/raith-away-report/) when the Cattachs gave an early warning to higher league opposition of what we are capable of.

It is an evening for reminiscing about our historic Scottich Cup run, where we travelled to Stranraer in the 3rd Round with a resounding 'Goals for: 10 - Goals against: 0' record. It is an evening to remember Sid's solo last minute winner at Stair Park; the backs to the wall defending of an early Colin Williamson goal in Methil; the fantastic response from both squad and supporters to our prize of a 5th Round place against the in form Kilmarnock.

It is an evening to celebrate the return of the North of Scotland Cup to Dudgeon Park. A time to look back on some special games and performances over the past season and beyond as we announce our Player of the Year Awards and the latest entrants to the Brora Rangers Hall of Fame.

As if all that wasn't enough to get you dancing in the streets of Brora ... the raucous tones of Ronnie 'n' Donnie certainly will!

So, whether it's playing a round at Brora Golf Club on the Friday, a round of applause at the Awards Ceremony, or dancing to a big round bloke and his skinny mate ... it's time to party all round.

**See you there!**
