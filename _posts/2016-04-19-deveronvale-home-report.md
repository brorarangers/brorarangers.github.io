Brora came from a goal down to beat Deveronvale at Dudgeon Park and end their season with a win in what was very much end of season fare. 

The home side rested Grant Munro and recalled Scott Houston to partner Colin Williamson at centre back. Ally MacDonald played in midfield, replacing the suspended Martin MacLean and Lewis Grant played in MacDonald’s normal left back position. 

Deveronvale also rung the changes and fielded several younger players and recent signings as they are clearly rebuilding their squad with next season in mind, particularly in light of the recent transfer of main striker Martin Charlesworth to Lossiemouth.   

The Cattachs didn’t show much of their customary purposeful football for much of this game. Maybe the immense highs and lows they experienced in the preceding week – winning the Highland League Cup for the first time on the Saturday then seeing the Championship slip away three days later – made it difficult to raise themselves psychologically to their normal heights. A lot of the opening exchanges were fairly sterile midfield play with neither goalkeeper seriously tested. 

However, the Banff side stunned the former champions when they opened the scoring in the 20th minute, Scott Fraser converting from the penalty spot after Scott Houston was adjudged by the assistant referee to have fouled James Duguid. The award seemed harsh as it appeared that Houston had himself been tripped at that point and his momentum made Duguid tumble. 

Ten minutes later, Deveronvale’s Ross Aitken appealed for another penalty but the tackle on him was clean and a goal kick was the verdict. The Cattachs were continuing to play well below their best and manifested a distinct lack of taking responsibility and having a go up front. However, the front men weren’t helped by a succession of high balls punted into the box that were meat and drink to the tall Deveronvale defenders. 

Vale’s Kevin Souter was the first name into the referee’s book for a foul in midfield and he was soon followed by James Duguid for a clear handball. Just before half time, Brora’s Lewis Grant received a yellow card for a tackle although he played the ball first. 

The second half started in much the same way as the first half. Cup Final penalty hero Joe Malin gave way at half time so Steven Martin took over between the sticks and was tested in the 51st minute by a good James Duguid strike from the edge of the box. A couple of minutes after this a surging run down the right flank and inviting cross by young Brora full back John Pickles was almost turned in at the far post by Steven MacKay as Brora now started to press consistently for the first time in the match. On 56 minutes, Scott Graham shot over from the edge of the box. 

Brora finally got on level terms in the 63rd minute in a fortuitous way when a long ball into the box by Dale Gillespie was turned into his own net by Vale central defender and captain Scott Fraser who thus earned the dubious distinction of scoring at the same end for both teams! 

The goal lifted Brora and some of the old swagger was returning. Zander Sutherland drove narrowly over the bar on the left after collecting a through ball. Although he can play the position very well, Ally MacDonald seemed to be labouring in his midfield role. He certainly didn’t seem to be running freely and he appeared to be limping at times. This put additional pressure on Dale Gillespie as Brora were often outnumbered in midfield but Gillespie continued to pull the strings as he has done with growing authority all season. One flowing move saw the ball move swiftly from Gillespie to Zander Sutherland to John Pickles whose cross was over hit. This was followed by another flowing move from Andrew Greig to John Pickles and this time his cross was a hairsbreadth too high for Zander Sutherland.to apply the finishing header. 

Brora had now started to find some of the rhythm that had swept all before them in recent seasons and one sensed that a goal was coming and 8 minutes from time it duly arrived. John Pickles fed substitute Paul Brindle on the flank and his perfect cross was met from 6 yards by Scott Graham who headed down into the corner of the net to give Brora the lead.

Deveronvale kept committing men forward at every opportunity and they spurned a gilt-edged opportunity to equalise a couple of minutes after Brora’s goal when Liam Forbes had a free header from a corner and sent it inches past the far post. That was the last real scare for Brora and, indeed, they almost scored again in added time when Zander Sutherland sliced a drive past the near post from 15 yards. The match concluded after Brora’s Colin Williamson was booked for a professional foul in midfield. 

It was a bitter-sweet season for Brora, They won the Highland League Cup for the first time but lost the chance of a third consecutive league title after leading the league for most of the season. Whilst we must congratulate the consistency of Cove, one can’t help but ponder on what might have been. 

If Brora had won the New Year home match against Nairn that they dominated and turned just one of the two home draws against Turriff or Inverurie into a win, then they would have retained the championship. It just goes to show how fine are the margins. However, Brora Rangers can look forward to the new season fully confident that they will be as strong as ever and be there or thereabouts when the 2016/17 honours 
are shared out.
