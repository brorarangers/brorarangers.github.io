The draw for the 2nd round of the William Hill Scottish Cup took place earlier today, with Brora entering the fray with a home game against Arbroath.

Brora travelled down to Abroath for a pre-season game before our 2014-15 league championship season, so they are not an entirely unknown entity. 

With the 'Red Lichties' sitting 3rd from bottom of the SPFL League 2, they appear to have finally found some form winning all of their last 3 games. However, Brora know more than most that we have little to fear from the SPFL teams on our own turf if we play to our capabilities.

The draw also created 3 all Highland League ties with Nairn facing Wick in a warm up for their North of Scotland Cup final, Turriff against Fraserburgh and Fort William against Cove Rangers. 

Buckie head down to our old happy hunting ground of Meadowbank Stadium to face Edinburgh City and Forres travel to East Kilbride, while Inverurie Loco Works entertain Edinburgh Uni, Formartine host Clyde, Huntly face East Stirlingshire and Clach welcome Linlithgow Rose.

The game kicks off at 3pm on Saturday 24th October, so get the calendar marked and let's get a good home crowd to cheer the lads through to the next round of the Scottish Cup.
