We are only hours away from 2015 coming to an end, so we thought it only right to have a look back at our season so far.

Last season officially ended for Brora later than the rest of the Highland League with our historic Pyramid Playoffs against SPFL side Montrose, and our ultimate defeat at Links Park on the 16th May. Whilst the squad didn't get much of a summer break before pre-season training started up again in preparation for our first friendly of the 2015/16 season against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, there was also plenty going on behind the scenes in June too.

We'd already signed John Pickles right at the end of May, and Richard Brittain and Paul Brindle put pen to paper on the 6th June. Ally Macdonald and Connor Lyall followed close on their heels on the 20th of the month.

Meanwhile some of our fantastic fans were getting their sleeves rolled up and doing their own work on the pitch.

The obviously camera shy duo of Alister Matheson and James Macbeath set about the Dudgeon turf with a vengeance, assisting our ever present Groundsman, Sandy (Not to be confused with [Groundskeeper Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundskeeper_Willie)) in getting the pitch in tip top condition for the coming season.

Less camera shy, and arguably less skilled, but definitely no less willing were the infamous 'Painters 11' who turned out to freshen up the dressing rooms.

What a fantastic effort from those who swapped a Saturday watching the Brora Rangers for a Sunday watching the youngsters paint. There were others who missed out on the photo call, probably because they were actually doing some work, but throughout the close season supporters gave up their time to wield paint brushes and more around Dudgeon Park and we can't thank them enough for their dedication to the Club.

The 8th of June saw the draw for the North of Scotland Cup announced, with Brora drawn at home against Wick Academy in the first round. What a cracking tie for our first competitive game of the new season.

By the end of June we had our pre-season friendlies sorted out and the Petrofac Cup draw saw us getting ready to face Championship side Alloa Athletic. So, no more hanging around ... and the 1st of July saw us welcome the Scottish Cup holders Inverness Caledonian Thistle to the Dudgeon.

We can only assume that ICT had neither been dazzled with the freshly painted away dressing room, nor affected by lingering paint fumes, as they scored in 14 minutes through Jordan Roberts. However, as the Inverness Courier reported after the match *'The Cattachs, managed by former Raith Rovers man Davie Kirkwood, were not overawed by the opposition and responded well to going behind. Wedderburn had to be alert to flick away a teasing Andy Greig cross and Ryan Esson stood tall to block an effort from Paul Brindle, making his first Brora appearance since moving from Clach.'*

*'Looking to get a foothold in the game, the two-time Highland League champions came close to reducing the deficit on the hour. Greig cut back inside on his right foot and stood the ball up to the back post for Colin Maclean, whose first-time effort rolled narrowly wide.'*

It wasn't to be, however, and the game finished with a 0-3 victory to the SPL side as they prepared themselves for their first game in the Europa League.

Three days later we travelled through to Aberdeen for a match against
