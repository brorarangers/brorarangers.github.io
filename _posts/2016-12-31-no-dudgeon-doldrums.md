It may be the doldrums between Christmas and the New Year but new Manager Ross Tokely has been busy.

With Joe Malin out for a month, Ross is delighted to have arranged with Ross County the loan of keeper Ross Munro.  

Joe has been struggling with a knee injury for sometime now and will undergo a scan and follow up treatment. In the interim Ross Munro will slip into the keepers jersey and it was hoped would make his debut against Huntly on Saturday.

Steven Mackay has also withdrawn his transfer request and will rejoin the squad for training this evening (Thursday). Likewise Scott Houston will also be returning to the club.

Ross Tokely commented "It was important that we did something about Joe's injury, as we did not want him to suffer long term damage and his mobility during a match was getting badly affected. Ross ( Munro) is highly regarded at County and we are very grateful for the support they are providing to us."

"Likewise it's great that Steven has reassessed his position and is returning to Brora and will fulfil the remainder of his contract with us. He still has much to offer the Club and I'm sure he will fit back in very comfortably. I've also spoken to Scott Houston and it's wonderful that he too is returning to training."
