On P&J Highland League flag day, Cove Rangers gave notice that they will be tough to dislodge from this season's roll of honour, when they came out 2-1 winners against fellow title challengers Brora Rangers.

No titles will have been won or lost on the back of this result, but early seasonal bragging rights belong to the Aberdeen outfit.

In what was an exciting match both teams had chances, but Cove always appeared to have the upper hand and set the tempo of the game.

Cove took an early lead through a Smith header which beat Malin, following some slack marking in the Cattachs back line. Whilst there was no further goals in the first half, on balance Cove went into the break as deserved leaders.

The second half started more brightly for Brora, but without really looking dangerous. In the 80th minute Cove were awarded what most people thought was a soft penalty after a clumsy Pickles challenge-which Megginson duly converted.

Dale Gillespie pulled one back for Brora, but it was all to late.

Not only did Cove and ourselves see this as the 'Big Game', so did Highland Football League sponsors The Press and Journal. Highlights are now published [here](https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/highland-league/the-big-game/1000251/watch-weeks-big-game-highlights-just-60-seconds/) with post match interviews [here](https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/highland-league/the-big-game/1000250/highland-league-managers-view-cove-rangers-v-brora-rangers/)
