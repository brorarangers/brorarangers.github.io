On P&J Highland League flag day, Cove Rangers gave notice that they will be tough to dislodge from this season's roll of honour, when they came out 2-1 winners against fellow title challengers Brora Rangers.

No titles will have been won or lost on the back of this result, but early seasonal bragging rights belong to the Aberdeen outfit.

In what was an exciting match both teams had chances, but Cove always appeared to have the upper hand and set the tempo of the game. They processed the guile to slow the match down once they had taken an early lead and from then on never looked in too much difficulty.

Cove took an early lead through a Smith header which beat Malin, following some slack marking in the Cattachs back line. A Harry Milne cross from the left picked out Smith at the near post and his glancing header was well positioned to beat the outstretched Joe Malin.

Brora had two half chances, but Williamson's header looped over the bar, whilst a ferocious drive from attacking full back John Pickles went just wide. Whilst there was no further goals in the first half, on balance Cove went into the break as deserved leaders

The second half started more brightly for Brora and Martin Maclean should have done better but his shot was straight at the Cove keeper and McKenzie had little difficulty in gathering it. Brora continued to press without really looking dangerous and looked resigned to being second best on the day.

In the 80th minute Cove were awarded what most people thought was a soft penalty after a clumsy Pickles challenge-which Megginson duly converted. Pickles should consider himself unlucky as the video replay clearly showed that he made contact with the ball first.

Dale Gillespie pulled one back for Brora, but it was all to late, as referee Duncan blew for time.

Brora Manager Grant Munro was critical of the Cattach' s performance especially given the importance of such a game. "Cove looked hungrier and it's in matches  like these that you need to raise your game, and we didn't., It's early in the season, but we need to up our game if we are going to be at the business end of the table again."said Munro.

Not only did Cove and ourselves see this as the 'Big Game', so did Highland Football League sponsors The Press and Journal.
