Our rearranged game against Fort William will be played at Dudgeon Park on Wednesday 2nd March KO 20:00 and the Huntly game, again at Dudgeon Park will be on Saturday 5th March KO 3.00pm 

It will be a most welcome return to league duties for the Cattachs and hopefully give us the opportunity to consolidate our position at the head of the table. 

See you all there!
