It's back to Dudgeon Park for our final pre-season friendly matches over the next two weekends, and first to face the Cattachs are Scottish Junior Football Association's Inverness City FC.

City play in the North Region of the Super League alongside our erstwhile Scottish Cup opponents from a couple of seasons ago, Banks o' Dee. The Club was founded in 2006, playing initially in the North Caledonian League. A successful application in 2008 saw the Club join the ranks of Junior Football, gaining promotion to the North Region's Division 1 for the 2009-10 season.

Brora come into this game after 3 impressive games against Forfar, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Ross County. The new management team have done a fantastic job getting the squad back together after the summer break and into gear so quickly, the squad have obviously been training hard and look extremely focused, determined and up for the season ahead. Focused, determined, and happy - the whole team seem to be really enjoying pre-season, and that can be infectious.

Don't be caught out by the early kick off on Saturday. In fact, as we have waived the entrance fee to this game, come along extra early - kick off is 2pm, so enjoy a pre-match drink in the Social Club, bring a friend that hasn't been to the football, and bring an umbrella, and a jacket. And be prepared to enjoy a pre-season game with a squad who will be eager to get their names on the scoresheet.

It is also your first chance to get your hands on a Season Ticket, they'll be on sale in the Boardroom.
