Brora suffered a set back on Saturday when they went down 0-2 to their league challengers at a wet Dudgeon Park. 

In a close fought first half, Formartine went into the break with a single goal lead, thanks to a well taken goal by Gary Wood after just 8 minutes,against the run of play. 

The second half was another tight affair, but the visitors secured the three points when substitute Neil Gauld headed in with 15 minutes remaining. 

Brora now slip to fourth position in the league and clearly defence of the title is going to be a tough challenge, but Player Manager Richard Brittain is backing his team to bounce right back.
