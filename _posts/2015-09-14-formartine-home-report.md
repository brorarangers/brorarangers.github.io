Brora Rangers drew a blank against Highland League rivals Formartine United at wet and windy Dudgeon Park last Saturday in what proved to be a frustrating afternoon for the league champions. 

Following hot on the heels of the 7-1 thrashing of Nairn County in mid-week confidence was high in the home camp, but an early goal for the visitors set trend for the rest of the match with the visitors content to hit their hosts on the break.

A stinging shot from Zander Sutherland in the second minute appeared to be tipped over the crossbar by Formartine goalkeeper Andy Reid. However, referee David Watt surprisingly awarded a goal kick.

The visitors took the lead six minutes later when Garry Wood drifted past a couple of defenders and from just inside the 18-yard box curled the ball into the far corner of the net. Brora had the chance to get back on level terms in the 12th minute when a diagonal ball from Sutherland found Steven MacKay in space but the Brora skipper tried to pick out Paul Brindle with a pass instead of having a go himself.

In a breakaway move five minutes later Scott Barbour swung a cross-field pass to Graeme Rodger who cut inside, but his shot was easily held by Brora keeper Joe Malin.

Brora continued to push for an equaliser and Sutherland almost caught Reid out at the far post in the 31st minute but the keeper managed to scramble the ball away. The home side continued to look for an opening and when a Gavin Morrison corner fell to Sutherland the wide man skewed his shot well wide of target. Just before half time Scott Graham headed over following a whipped in cross from Dale Gillespie.

Formartine threatened early in the second half when Stuart Smith headed a Paul Lawson cross just past then Barbour had a header deflected over for a corner. The pressure paid off in the 75th minute when Formartine substitute Neil Gauld got on the end of a Lawson free kick to head in from close range.

The nearest Brora came to a goal was in the final minute. Reid failed to hold a powerful free kick from Richard Brittain but he reacted well to block Grahamâ€™s point-blank shot.
