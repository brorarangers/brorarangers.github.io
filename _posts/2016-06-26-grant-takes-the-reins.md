Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the appointment of Grant Munro as Team Manager with immediate effect. Grant was originally to assist Stuart Golabek, but work commitments abroad led Stuart to reluctantly resign his position. 

Stuart felt, perfectly understandably that it would not be fair to the Club or the players for him to continue in post and has passed the reins over to Grant.

Grant enthused about his his new position and made clear to the players at this mornings training in Alness, exactly what his standards and expectations are. Needless to say regaining the Press & Journal league title is the principal one.

Grant is to continue playing this season and to assist him Steven MacDonald (Biscuits) has been appointed as his assistant. 

Steven commented "I'm absolutely delighted to be joining such an ambitious and progressive club, and look forward to working with Grant and the players. This mornings training session was a excellent high tempo work out and all the players and I are looking forward to the season ahead".

Speaking on behalf of the Board, William Powrie said " We fully understand the difficult position Stuart was in, and his professional working commitments needed to come first. In Grant Munro we have a natural leader who commands the utmost respect of the players and we are sure will make a seamless progression into his new role". 

"We are equally delighted to have secured the services of Steven MacDonald as his assistant. Steven has vast footballing experience and will bring some exciting new concepts into training and on pitch play".
