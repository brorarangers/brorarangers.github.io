Brora moved into send place in the Press & Journal Highland League, as they "murdered" a previously unbeaten Lossimouth outfit 7-0 at Dudgeon Park. 

In a display to equal anything seen at Dudgeon Park for many a year, Brora produced a performance over 90 minutes, which signalled their intent to recover the League crown lost to Cove Rangers last season. 

Brora started at a high tempo and never let the pace drop throughout the 90 minutes. It's wasn't that Lossiemouth were poor, they just were not allowed any time on the ball as the Cattach players chased down every opportunity. 

On the eve of Autumn you could have been forgiven in thinking it was December, as a rasping wind blew in from the North Sea. However on the park, the temperature was rising as Brora delivered a brand of incisive cross field passing and thrusting attacks. 

Brora had the ball in the net after a few minutes, but although Sutherland finished well Craig Campbell was adjudged to have been offside. 

Brora took a deserved lead after 10 minutes when Brindle thumped home a rebound from the keeper who had done well to stop a Sutherland volley. Lossie's one and only chance of the game came after 18 minutes, but Archiebald took too long to tee up his shot and Colin Williamson cleared the danger. 

Brora went 2 up when Brindle finished a wonderful Sutherland cross with a header beyond the flapping McConnachie. Brindle got his hat-trick 5 minutes from half time  when he again headed home a cross , this time from the industrious John Pickles. 

The second half started, just as the first, with Brora Rangers dominating the play. The midfield of Gillespie, Morrison and Maclean were imperious and their distribution at times was breathtaking. 

Within 10 minutes Craig Campbell had added another, having reacted quickest in a goalmouth scramble. Sutherland then hit a 35 yard peach which the keeper could not react to and Campbell added number 6 shortly thereafter. 

Lossiemouth had no answer to the continual  waves of Brora attacks and James Ross got into the act adding a 7th just before the end. 

To a man every Brora player received top marks. Both Brindle and Morrison left the field with knocks, but it's hoped they will be fit for the visit to Huntly on Saturday.
