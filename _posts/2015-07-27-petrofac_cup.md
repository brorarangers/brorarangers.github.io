title: Petrofac Cup First Round - 25/07/2015

Brora made an early exit from this years Petrofac Challange Trophy at the hands of SPFL Championship side Alloa Athletic 1-0.

A 49th minute strike by Geoff Mitchell separated the teams. The general consensus from the Alloa travelling fans was that Brora were very unlucky not to take the tie into extra time at the very least.

We missed a couple good opportunities and Alloa's keeper made some excellent saves as Brora delivered attack after attack.

Despite the disappointment of the exit, Brora significantly raised the bar from a below par performance against Wick and we must be optimistic about opening our league account at Lossiemouth on Wednesday evening.
