Brora Rangers made an early exit from this years Petrofac Challange Trophy at the hands of SPFL Championship side Alloa Athletic 1-0 at Dudgeon Park on Saturday. A 49th minute strike by 6'4" wasp Geoff Mitchell separated the teams and it is Alloa Athletic that go forward to play Elgin City in the 2nd Round.

Whilst the defeat was disappointing, Brora controlled the game for long periods in the second half and can consider themselves most unfortunate that they did not force an equaliser which would have seen a much deserved period of extra  time.

Brora Rangers saw the return of Scott Houston into the centre back position with player manager Ritchie Brittain posting himself onto the bench.

After the unexpected midweek defeat to Wick ( on penalties) Brora started the game the stronger with Stuart Kettlewell making his presence felt in the middle of the park. There were few clear cut chances in the first 45 minutes, with perhaps Alloa just shading the balance of play.

Joe Malin in the Brora goal was forced to make saves from Geoff Mitchell and a close range header from the dangerous Colin Hamilton. In the Alloa goal, David Crawford denied Steven Mackay and the busy Zander Sutherland, to keep the score goalless at half time.

Brora started the brighter in the second half with Stuart Kettlewell and Dale Gillespie imperious in the middle of the park. However it was Gillespie who gave the ball away in the Alloa half, which led to a rapier like pass from Iain Flannigan to the fleet of foot Mitchell who finished his chance well, passed the outstretched Malin.

Falling behind seemed to bring the best out of Brora, who continued to play a neat passing game and increasingly pushed Alloa back into their own half. A golden opportunity to equalise was missed by Martin MacLean when from only a few yards out as he fluffed a weak effort with an open goal at his mercy.

Steven Mackay was dangerous every time he saw the ball and brought a great save from the Alloa keeper after a rasping drive. Further top quality saves from the industrious Sutherland and again from  Mackay kept the Clackmanonshire side ahead.

With time running out, Sutherland turned his marker and headed direct at the Alloa goal. However he was clipped down by last man Hamilton and to the astonishment of players and supporters alike neither the referee nor the linesman were minded to give the free kick, and Brora were denied a clear opportunity to level the tie.

Despite Grant Munro advancing up the field in the final minutes the Wasps held on for their 1-0 victory. The Brora team were given a standing ovation as they left the park.

Ritchie Brittain paid tribute to his battling Brora side, describing their efforts as "momentous",  whilst Alloa manager Danny Lennon commented that " Brora could comfortably hold their own in the SPFL".
