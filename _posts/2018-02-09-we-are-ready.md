Today's penultimate pre William Hill Scottish Cup tie article comes from Brora Rangers Chairman, William Powrie.

Well that’s the final preparation training session now complete, and the boys are buzzing. We’re just about there and I for one can’t wait. Whatever happens on Saturday, win, lose or draw I want everybody to enjoy themselves and make a noise for Sutherland from the stand.

We take our place against Kilmarnock in the fifth round of the Scottish cup, having previously accounted for SPFL opposition in both Stranraer and East Fife. Make no mistake we are there on merit, and I know that once again the boys will put up a very credible account of themselves.

Ross Tokely, has prepared the players well, and we go into the match knowing we have nothing to fear, and whilst Kilmarnock are one of the top teams In the country, we will do ourselves and the Highland League proud.

I have literally been overwhelmed with the messages of good luck, and once again it looks as if we will not be short of support on our big day. At the last count we have five buses going to the match, and numbers will be swelled further by ex-pat supporters living in and around the Central Belt.

We have had bags of media coverage, and it makes me very proud that the football team has in some small way promoted the broader interests of Brora. The BBC will be carrying a piece on the club and the village on it’s iconic Football Focus programme which will be screened throughout the UK at 12 PM on Saturday. Certainly well worth a watch if you’re not en-route to Rugby Park.

I would like to thank sincerely the shopkeepers in the village who so kindly have given up their valuable window space to promote the club on this most eventful journey of ours.

Finally, can I ask as many of you as possible take photos of the day. We will get plenty of match shots from the professional photographers but I think it would be great that over the next week, we pull together photos of the journey, the fans, selfies and literally anything with encompasses the experience of the day.

**Have a safe journey, enjoy the day and thank you in advance for your wonderful support.**
