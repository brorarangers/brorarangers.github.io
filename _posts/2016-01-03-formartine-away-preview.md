It's time for Brora Rangers to shake off the New Year hangover and go First Footing at North Lodge Park next weekend. Tradition states that to bring good fortune to your guests, the first to cross the threshold should be a tall, dark haired male. 

Zander Sutherland, perfect. Let's face it, this will be a 'no quarter asked, and no quarter given' affair. No harm in sending the wee fellow in first to set the tone.

After the results of last weekend, this is a crucial match for both sides. Mathematically we both know the League is far from over. Theoretically we can see there are plenty of tough games to come between now and the end of April. Possibly there can be more upsets dealt out to compare with the Nairn County and Inverurie Loco Works wins at the start of their year. Realistically, this game means everything to ourselves and Kris Hunter's lads.

The last time we paid a visit to North Lodge Park we came home 5 goals to the good. That was last season, Formartine have only lost at home once this season. Then again, no one had beaten Cove Rangers this season until they met us at Dudgeon Park.

No doubt about it, we are right at the sharp end of a Battle Royal this season. Formartine Utd are snapping at our heels with the amount of goals they are scoring just now and, despite the loss of Craig McKeown through injury, are keeping it tight at the back.

We'll say this again over the coming weeks, we don't apologise for repeating ourselves. It's a case of 'one game at a time' from here on in, and this is a huge game in our quest for 3 Highland League Championships in a row. This is a huge game in our quest to make history and be the first Highland League Club to gain entry to the SPFL through the Pyramid system.

**This is a game where we need you to back the team in every way possible. Come and help us make history at North Lodge Park on Saturday 9th January.**
