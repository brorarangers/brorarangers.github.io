There is something of the anti-climax inevitable in having to celebrate the 'end of season' before the season ends ... but we like to think we pulled it off last Saturday.

To be honest, we got things underway on the Friday with our Golf Day - cold, windy and as our [Chairman reports](/2018/04/17/the-weekend-that-was/) brutal weather notwithstanding - another hugely successful competition with worthy winners.

As fate would have it, the weather improved significantly by Saturday afternoon making perfect conditions for our home game against Cove Rangers. A narrow 0-1 loss, whilst frustrating, wasn't enough to dampen the spirits for those who retired to the Social Club for our annual Player of the Year award ceremony.

The photo at the head of this article leaves little doubt as to who both the Brora Rangers supporters and players judged their star man of the 2017-18 season. Colin Williamson practically swept the board picking up the Supporters Club Player of the Year, Players Player of the Year and the Supporters Player of the Year trophies. That's quite an accolade in a record breaking Scottish Cup run season, and, unusually for Colin, a season where he didn't take the pitch with a bandage round his head, a broken nose, dislocated shoulder, broken collar bone or all the usual injuries he picks up with his 'do or die trying' technique.

For all his commanding presence on the pitch, Colin is a quiet, unassuming lad when it comes to award ceremonies - his acceptance speeches were brief to say the least - and he had the grace to leave a further award on the table for a team mate.

With the team mate heading north for the ferry back to Orkney, Jamie Duff accepted our award for Young Player of the Year on behalf of John Pickles. John has made this trophy his own over the past few seasons, and it is worth remembering that we've had Young Player of the Year winners go on to pick up the Highland League Player of the Year in previous years ... we can see no reason why John can't go on to repeat that feat in seasons to come.

That wasn't the end of the awards, nor the last of the recipients who were unable to be present due to being located on the waters around Scotland.

Our Hall of Fame gained two new inductees in the shape of to former great players for the Club in years gone by ... Donald Allan made it back down the road to accept his induction, Stephen Cowie was forced to send his daughter Nicole to accept the honour on his behalf.

We wouldn't like to hazard a guess at the hours and miles these two Caithness based stalwarts put in for training and playing over the years, but their contribution to some very successful seasons is never in doubt.

With the formal part of the evening over, the rest of the night was left in the safe hands of Ronnie n Donnie. Rock me mama like the wind and the rain? Rock me mama like a south bound train? Of course they did!

And so to the Sunday afternoon. After an Under 17 meeting between ourselves and Nairn County, which we ran out 6-2 winners, it was time for our Brora Rangers Youth Initiative awards.

Head of Youth Development at the Club, Dale Pryde-MacDonald has been exceptionally busy this season along with the rest of his team. In a week where we have more news, and a few important announcements to make, the Brora Rangers Youth Initiative definitely deserve an article all to themselves.

Whilst the accolades have been handed out, the season isn't over for us yet - and there is a final home game against Huntly to look forward to on Saturday.
