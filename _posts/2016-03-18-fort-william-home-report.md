Four goals in the first 45 gave Brora Rangers a big enough cushion to keep the important 3 points at home on Wednesday night despite a spirited Fort William performance.

Whilst the haar settled on Dudgeon Park, visibility obviously wasn't a problem for Dale Gillespie and Ally Macdonald who grabbed 2 goals apiece in the opening 30 minutes.

With Zander Sutherland sitting this game out due to suspension and Joe Malin recovering from his injury in our thriller at North Lodge Park, the strength and depth of this season's Brora squad was clear. Martin Maclean, Andrew Greig and Paul Brindle starting on the bench is a pretty good indication of the scoring potential of the Cattachs, and the ever patient Steven Martin started his second game in the goalmouth after his penalty saving heroics at the weekend. Making his first appearance for the Club was local lad Ali Sutherland - a debut which didn't fail to impress the home fans.

Whilst the haar didn't stop the lads finding their target, it was thick enough to delay the kick off for 15 minutes to allow some of the late arriving visitors to prepare themselves for what was to become an early Brora onslaught. Well aware of the danger John McLeod posed sprinting into their box with the ball at his feet, Fort William gave away a penalty 15 minutes later, allowing Dale Gillespie to calmly convert and put Brora into an early lead. 

Minutes later some fine work from debutant Sutherland allowed Ally MacDonald to double the score, and it looked as if Brora had full intentions of making sure that Formartine's ever increasing Goal Difference would not be our downfall come the 16th of April.

Scott Houston picked up a Yellow Card for what the referee adjudged an unfair challenge, whilst the home supporters awarded the Fort William forward 8.4, 8.6, 8.5.

Ally Macdonald kept up the pressure with his second, this goal coming from a Richie Brittain free kick, and Gillespie followed up with his second penalty conversion after Grant Munro was pulled down in the box. At this stage Brora were utterly dominant and Macdonald was making no secret of his desire to get forward for his hat-trick, with Munro pushing forward on the opposite wing and the electric pace of Ali Sutherland keeping Fort William well hemmed in. A half time score of 4-0 whetted the appetite of the home support for what promised to be another high scoring victory for the Reds.

It's impossible to avoid the tired cliche, this was indeed a game of two halves. Games between ourselves and Fort William are always high scoring affairs, and the West Coasters show little respect for our League flag or our obvious desire to retain it.

With an eye to the upcoming fixtures, Brora made changes early on, with Andrew Greig replacing Dale Gillespie and a corresponding shuffle of formation. Greig looked sharp and pushed forward immediately, but struggled to get his shots on target. Next to come off the bench was Martin Maclean, replacing stand in Captain Morrison. By now Fort William had fought their way back into the game and the expected spate of Brora goals was looking increasingly unlikely.

Fort's Darren Quigg ensured the goals weren't over for the evening though, grabbing their first from the penalty spot. Our final substition saw top scorer Brindle come on for McLeod and Brora seemed to get back into their stride with attempts from Sutherland, Graham, Munro and Brindle all failing to get across the line. Meanwhile at the other end, Adam Porritt marked his first game back at Dudgeon Park in opposition colours with his first and Fort William's second to leave the full time score at Brora 4-2 Fort William.

Meanwhile, our fellow challengers were keeping the race for the League flag alive. Formartine Utd coming back from a goal down to beat Deveronvale 4-1, and Cove Rangers going home with a 1-2 victory from Station Park.

Next up for Brora are the Inverurie Loco Works [at home on Saturday](/2016/03/17/locos-home-preview.html), another big game, another vital step in our plans for 3 League titles in a row and another step towards the Pyramid Play-off.
