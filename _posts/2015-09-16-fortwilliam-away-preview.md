It's time for Brora to take their annual trip through to the only pitch with a backdrop that can outdo our own.

It's usually a favourite venue for supporters and players alike. Second to bottom of the table, Fort have chalked up two wins this season but seem to have lost the momentum they gained last season.

Both teams come into this game after defeats last weekend, but Fort William's single goal deficit to Keith should be a warning that they are no walkover.

It's always dangerous to make a prediction about weather at the foot of The Ben, but the Met Office are suggesting a fine afternoon.

The Supporters Club are running a bus to Fort William, with pick ups from all points between and a canal side pit stop at Fort Augustus. £20.00 for members and £23.00 for non-members. If you fancy a trip that is always one of the highlights of the season, [get in touch here](mailto:brorarangers@gmail.com).
