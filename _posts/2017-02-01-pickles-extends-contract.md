Hot defender John Pickles has extended his contract with Brora Rangers until the end of the 2018/19 season.

Pickles, who recently made the P&J team of the year, was delighted to commit his immediate future to the Cattachs.

"I've really enjoyed my time with Brora, and they have been especially understanding given that I remain living on the Orkney Isles."

Speaking on behalf of the club, Ross Tokely said, "I'm delighted that John has extended his contract. He is a fine young attacking minded full back and highly regarded by his peers"
