Going forward Brora Rangers will be launching a new match day programme and looking to substantially increase our exposure in the local press.

 
What we are looking for is an enthusiastic, reliable person who would like to write a report on our home matches for publication. This is a wonderful opportunity for someone to take the first steps on a potential career path or just an established supporter who has always fancied airing their match views. 
 
Fancy having a go, or you know someone who may?,then for further information please contact william.powrie1@btopenworld.com
 
This is going to be another exciting season and here is an opportunity to be right at the heart of it.
