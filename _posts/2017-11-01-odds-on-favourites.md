As we get ready for our Cup Final weekend we continue to ponder what we would do if we were to win the Cattachs Lotto before the end of the year.

The [trip to El Clasico](/2017/10/29/cattachs-lotto/) has been postponed in preference for a trip to Forres, and the Supporters Club have missed out on [their own transport](/2017/10/30/lotto-spending-spree/). Buying a round at the Social Club and even a rare [bottle of Brora has been discounted](/2017/10/31/dugga's-millions/), but despite having won nothing yet, the **£7,300.00** Jackpot continues to burn a hole in our pocket.

Of course, we may be worrying needlessly. Perhaps the chances of us ever winning the Cattachs Lotto are so meager that we should focus on the half time 50/50 draw on Saturday afternoons. Or perhaps not.

This weekend the Euromillions Jackpot sits at a cool £25 million. For a £2.50 ticket you have a chance to win big. Well, when we say *'a chance'* it is really one chance in 139,838,160. Saturday evening's National Lottery is offering a £6.8 million Jackpot tonight. The chances of picking the winning 6 numbers on your £2.00 ticket? 1 in 45,057,474.

Given the problems we've had so far deciding how to spend the Cattachs **£7,300.00** Jackpot we shudder at the thought of deliberating over a multi-million £ payout. But at those odds, we won't lose any sleep over it.

With our Cattachs Lotto, however, it all seems so much more attainable. Pick 5 numbers from 1 - 20. Chances of scooping the Jackpot? 1 in 15,504. Chances of helping to support Brora Rangers Football Club when you purchase your Lotto ticket? 100% guaranteed.

As we head into the weekend and our North of Scotland Cup final with Lossiemouth, we are more than aware that when it comes to football matches, especially Cup Finals, 'odds on favourites' counts for little. Given the difference in chances of winning the Euromillions compared to the Cattachs Lotto, you have to admit ... the odds are stacked in your favour.

We are off to focus on increasing our odds of hanging on to the NoS Cup for the next few days ... but not until we fill in our [Lotto Standing Order](/lotto/) and get it sent in before Sunday's draw.

Hopefully our [Facebook friends](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) followers can help us out with more ideas next week for ways to spend a Lotto Jackpot.
