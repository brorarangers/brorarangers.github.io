The Highland League has been a hot bed for talent in years gone by, and, there is no doubt Brora Rangers capture of Gavin Morrison was certainly in the top ten of signings made in the Highland League by any club.

The Former Inverness Caledonian Thistle Midfielder joined Brora back in 2013 and has today committed his future to the Cattachs until the end of season 2019/2020.

Speaking to the club website Morrison left no questions about committing himself to Brora “I have dedicated my future to Brora Rangers as I feel like a part of this club, and also respect how well everybody from the board, the players and the supporters have treated me over the last 4 years. I also firmly believe in what we are trying to achieve here. With everybody buying in- the players, board and fans, I am very confident of achieving the goals we have set ourselves.”

“I am very hungry for success, and those that know me know that. If I am being totally honest, we have failed collectively as a group in terms of the Highland League Championship. Being in the top 3 doesn’t interest me, I want to win, whether its league titles or cup competitions, that will be my focus for as long as I am here”

Morrison was part of the very impressive double championship winning side under David Kirkwood and played alongside current Manager Ross Tokely in those title winning campaigns. Gavin was very enthusiastic to highlight the strengths he feels Tokely brings to the Brora Management hot seat and why he wanted to stay under Tokely’s new regime.

“I have a lot of respect for Ross, he looked out for me at Inverness Caley when we were both there and I was new to the first team and young. It was also tremendous to play with him at Brora when we won the 2 championships back to back. He is a winner and demands the best from us every training session and on a match day. He brings the pressures and challenges that I enjoy playing under.”

When reflecting on the team around him Morrison made it very clear he feels that more can still be accomplished at Dudgeon Park. “We are nowhere near done with the championship & trophies. When I look at the players around me in our dressing room there is huge talent there and only adds to my belief that we can get the league championship back to Brora. It hurts not winning the league and we will all be using those feelings to drive us on and improve next season”

Morrison’s new deal keeps him at Dudgeon Park until June 2020 and is the first extension signed under Ross Tokely. There is no doubt there will be more activity to come from Dudgeon Park over the coming weeks and months but a fantastic way to start the summer for the Brora Rangers board and supporters.
