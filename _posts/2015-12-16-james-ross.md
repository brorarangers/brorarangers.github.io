It really doesn't seem that long since James was pulling on the red shirt of the Cattachs. Back in November of last year, when Ross Tokely headed for foreign shores, the Press and Journal ran a short article where Davie Kirkwood was quoted as saying 'That’s where Scott and young James have to come to the fore ...'

No doubt about it, then. Young James seems to have come to the fore ...

James has featured in an [STV video interview](http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/ross-county/1336177-remember-the-name-james-ross-journey-from-plumber-to-the-premiership/) as part of a series spotlighting up and coming talent from Scotlands top teams.

As captain of Ross County's Under 20 squad, everyone is delighted to see James get the recognition we all know he deserves.
