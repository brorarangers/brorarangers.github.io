If we thought our nerves were frayed  last week against Formartine United, Cattachs fans were again treated to a nail biting Penalty shoot out, this time against Cove Rangers in the semi- final of the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup. 

After little separating the teams at 90 minutes with the score of 1-1, extra time saw both sides add a second for the tie to finish 2-2. 

Once again, the Brora marksmen were on target from the spot, and it was left to Brora keeper Steve Martin to produce a brilliant diving save from Duff, to catapult Brora into the final. 

The League Cup Final against Nairn County will be held on the 9th April at Grant Street Park, Inverness.
