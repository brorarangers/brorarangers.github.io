For the second week in succession  Cattachs fans were again treated to a nail biting penalty shoot out, this time against league title rivals Cove Rangers in the semi- final of the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup. 

After little separating the teams at 90 minutes with the score of 1-1, extra time saw both sides add a second for the tie to finish 2-2. 

Once again, the Brora marksmen were on target from the spot, and it was left to Brora keeper Steve Martin to produce a brilliant diving save from Duff, to catapult Brora into the final, where they will meet Nairn County at Grant Street Inverness, who reached the final after their 2-0 defeat of Turriff United. 

On a spring like day at Dudgeon Park, Brora made two changes from their previous week's starting line up , with Andrew Greig coming in for Scotty Graham and Steve Martin replacing the injured Joe Malin in goal. 

Brora certainly started the brighter with some early pressure on the Cove defence, with top scoring striker Paul Brindle firing over from 5  yards with the goal at his mercy. The normally clinical finisher then misfired again with his effort going into the side netting. 

Cove gradually marshalled their troops and their first real chance was wasted after some good work by Blair Yule. However it was Brora who deservedly opened the scoring after 18 minutes when Martin Maclean poked the ball home, following an accurate free kick from stand-in Captain Gavin Morrison. 

The remainder of the first half was played mainly in the middle third of the pitch, as both sets of defenders were in the ascendancy. Munro, Pickles, Williamson and Houston were a strong rearguard and stand in keeper Martin, had only really to deal with longer range efforts from the Cove front line. 

However with the minutes ticking away to the interval, Cove found themselves on level terms, when Yule finished well into the bottom of the net, past the outstretched Martin.  

Clearly the half time team talks for both sides, focused on not conceding further goals, as chances were few and far between for either side. There were some signs of weary legs in the Brora midfield, as perhaps the toils of last week's game at Formartine took their toll. John Pickles was unable to make the restart, after a knock to the head  and was replaced by Ally MacDonald. Paul Brindle who is never seen to best effect on heavy going, was replaced by Scotty Graham. 

Whilst Cove had the balance of possession,the second half passed without any clear cut chances, with both keepers coping comfortably when called to duty. 

The 90 minutes were brought to a close without further goals being added, and once again the Cattachs were to face a period of extra time on an energy sapping heavy pitch. 

Little quarter was surrendered in the first period of extra time, but the deadlock was broken as Martin Maclean netted his and Brora's second after some nifty footwork from Dale Gillespie, as he rounded 3 Cove defenders, and unselfishly found Maclean. 

Brora were now running on empty, and were forced to mount a rearguard action as Cove threw everybody forward in search of an equaliser, and it came with 6 minutes to spare, when Watson was on hand to fire home after Brora failed to deal with a Cove cross. 

The match ended without further incident and it was once again down to penalties for a place in the final. 

Cove missed their first two spot kicks, both striking the woodwork, whilst Morrison and Munro converted for Brora. Cove scored their third as did Brora, but Stevie Martin, who had been waiting 3 years for his chance in goal, made a superb save from Duff, to cap another wonderful day for the Brora fans. 

Brora manager Richard Brittain was delighted with the commitment and application shown by his side once again, whilst acknowledging the contribution made by Cove. 

With rearranged fixtures coming thick and fast over the next 4 weeks the strength in depth of the Brora squad will never be so important, as Brittain juggles to keep legs fresh. 

Brora resume league duties this week and have a home tie against Fort William on Wednesday evening. On Saturday Inverurie Loco's are the visitors in what is always an entertaining encounter.
