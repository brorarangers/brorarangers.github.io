Whilst all the clubs in the Scottish Highland Football League are currently looking at the weather forecasts for the rest of February and throughout March, we are also keeping a weather eye on the longer term forecast.

We are confident the day we have in mind be a gorgeous day, we are confident it will be an auspicious day for all involved. Friday 13th April 2018 will hold none of the negative connotations that those of a superstitious nature would like to attach to a Black Friday. Not in Brora.

Certainly not if previous years are anything to go by. Friday 13th April this year is the Brora Rangers Golf Day, and we've had no negative experiences to attach to this event.

Whilst the popular quote often attributed to Mark Twain suggests that *'Golf is a good walk spoiled'*, past Brora Rangers Golf Days probably fit better with American sports writer, Bob Ryan's, words,

>*"A passion, an obsession, a romance, a nice acquaintanceship with trees, sand and water."*

The fact that our Golf Day is held at our [website sponsor's course](https://broragolfclub.co.uk/), and includes bacon rolls, Pimms, cupcakes, a three course meal and prizes can only add to the assurance of a fantastic day out.

It's a four ball competiton again, with an entry price of Â£280.00 per team.

Interested? Of course you are.
