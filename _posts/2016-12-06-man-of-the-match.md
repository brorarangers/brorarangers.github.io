Jamie Duff hasn't taken long to make his mark on the Brora squad as he was voted 'Cattachs Man of the Match' by our Match Sponsors after our game against Cove Rangers last Saturday.

Jamie was presented with a small gift token, always useful in the run up to Christmas, by Russell Jaffrey in our Sponsors Lounge after the game.

Our Match Sponsors were the recipients of gifts of their own on Saturday evening, when Dennis Bridgeford presented small engraved momentos of a great day out to them after the Man of the Match award.

Our thanks go again to Stuart Clark and his guests, definite contenders for the rowdiest table award; MacDonald School of Motoring, most of whom earned a well deserved break from their usual matchday work of manning the turnstiles and sellng our programme and 50/50 tickets;

Xererec and their guests, who help us greatly with our printing and media requirements throughout the season;

And Callum Duff, with his partner in crimes against music in their alter-ego Ronnie 'n' Donnie guise ... always firm favourites with the Brora supporters when football time makes way for dancing time

Fancy a bit of VIP treatment at Dudgeon Park yourself? We are already fully booked for our next home game against Turriff Utd, but you could book a table for a real Hogmanay treat when we welcome Huntly to Brora on the last day of 2016. We also have places available for our match with Deveronvale on the 21st January, and for the Big Game against Buckie on the 4th February. As usual, get in touch with [Russell](mailto:russell.jaffrey@btinternet.com) or [David](mailto:david@cairngormgroup.co.uk) for further details.
