The last time Fraserburgh made the long trip North to Dudgeon Park we only let them head home again after a 6-0 thrashing.

It's worth dwelling on that for a minute, as previous games against The Broch in recent seasons have proven to be less happy occasions for The Cattachs. It never pays to underestimate Fraserburgh. 

Whilst we have to go back to December 2013 to find our last defeat against The Broch, they've kept us in check, including a 1-1 draw at Dudgeon Park a year later when few other teams could come close to matching us.

Fraserburgh come into this game sitting 5th in the League with 20 points and a game in hand over everyone apart from Turriff Utd, and their away record is impressive ... three wins and a draw against Cove Rangers.

But let's not dwell on that, let's continue to reminisce on our 6-0 victory last time round. This was the Fraserburgh squad that picked up both their Regional trophies, the Fraserburgh who were unbeaten the League, Aberdeenshire Shield and Aberdeenshire Cup against League Champions, Cove Rangers. Fraserburgh were having a season of giant killing ... but not the Brora giants.

Brora giants ... Paul Brindle may not be the tallest of Highland League strikers, but he scored 4 that day. Brora giants ... Zander Sutherland, who rumour has it requires turn ups sewn into his shorts, was either setting up Brindle or firing the ball in the net himself from 15 yards out. Brora giants ... Andrew Greig, knee high to ... well, knee high to Zander Sutherland, ran the Fraserburgh defence ragged. Dale Gillespie scored the final goal of the game, he's quite tall.

As with so many fixtures this season between many of our sister Clubs, the outcome on Saturday is far from certain. But we're confident ... we've got some giants on our side.

It's a 3pm kick-off, the forecasters promise us this bright and fairly mild spell of weather will continue over the weekend, and the lads need your support as we head into an exciting and challenging October.

**See you there**
