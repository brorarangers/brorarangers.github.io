Brora will look to bounce back after last weekend's defeat to fellow title challengers Cove Rangers, and a trip to Fraserburgh will without doubt prove a terrific test to our resilience.

In a twist of fate, Fraserburgh were the last side to take 3 points from the Cattachs in the Highland League, way back in December 2013.

Fraserburgh themselves have had a mixed run of results so far this season, with victories over Keith and Rothes and, perhaps surprising, defeats by Buckie Thistle and Lossiemouth.

However, it would be a naive side that turns up to the Bellslea on Saturday expecting an easy game.

The Supporters Club will be running a bus to Fraserburgh. Get in touch to book your seat for another important match in Brora's attempt to clinch their 3rd successive League Championship.
