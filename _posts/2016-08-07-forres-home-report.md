Brora Rangers picked up 3 excellent points at home to a hard working and very physical Forres Mechanics yesterday.

Forres who had drawn with Inverurie Loco's in their opening game, arrived in confident mood, but in truth did not trouble the Cattachs, albeit it they did frustrate them for the first 45 minutes.

Brora started the match brightly, but their finishing was well below par with far too many balls delivered in the air into the penalty box, where the big Forres centre backs had little difficulty in dealing with them.

The second period saw a distinct change of tactics from Steven MacDonald, and Brora played a much more ground passing game, and very quickly dominated the match.

Three second half goals from Campbell, Gillespie ( Pen) and Brindle carried Brora over the line, whilst at the other end Joe Malin had but a few long range polks to deal with.

Forres will be tough opposition to many teams this year, and this win was perhaps a much better result than perhaps first thought.
