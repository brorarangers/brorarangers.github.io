That's the end of the Pre Season friendlies for Brora Rangers. 

We head into our first competitive match of the 2015/16 season on Wednesday night with what promises to be an exciting match against Wick Academy in the first round of the North of Scotland Cup.
 
Richard Brittain took the reins in his first game as Manager in our final pre season friendly against Clyde FC on Saturday and, despite a no scoring draw, there was plenty of entertaining football for both sets of supporters.
