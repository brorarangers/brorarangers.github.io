In what was a landmark evening for Brora Rangers Football Club there were 3 new inductees in to the Hall of Fame.

The event which celebrated its second year recognised three people who have dedicated so much to the club through successful and difficult times and noted the tremendous amount of hours given.

From the picture above there are few who would not recognise those photographed. Gavin MacLeod, a tireless servant to the club who has dedicated over 40 years of service was first inducted.

He was followed by John Suttar, whose award was accepted by former Brora Manager Bobby Duffy.

The final entrant in to the Hall of Fame received a standing ovation that was truly deserved. Sheena Manson, a face not only of the club but of the village who has been with the club over 40 years and welcomes thousands of players, managers and committee members to the Social Club as well as the football club.

In what was another fantastic evening we give thanks to the 3 inductees and our guest compere Ian Thain and speaker, former SPL Referee Kenny Clark.

We still have hospitality available for this weekends forthcoming Breedons League Cup First Round Match with Inverurie Locos. With the Cup Sponsors in attendance and the Second Round draw being conducted in Brora after the game it will be a fantastic day to be around a close, tight and, we are confident, entertaining cup tie.
