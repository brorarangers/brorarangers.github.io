Nairn County have got off to a fine start this season with victories over Deveronvale, Lossiemouth, Rothes and Keith. 

Slip ups against Wick Academy and Buckie Thistle at either end of August see them sitting in 5th place and the 3 points on offer look pretty important to both sides given the battle going on presently at the top of the Hghland League table.

Brora haven't lost a League game against Nairn since January 2013 in a tightly fought 3-4 game at Dudgeon Park, but it's all up for grabs again on Wednesday night as Brora try to build their winning streak back up again.

Two things are certain, it won't be a dull game, and you won't be standing in the old Cowshed at Station Park.
