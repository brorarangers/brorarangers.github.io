John Latham is on a monster tour of all the SPL, Championship, League 1 and 2, Highland and Lowland League grounds this month.

He is raising funds for [British Blind Sport](http://www.britishblindsport.org.uk/), a charity which enables blind and partially sighted people to have the same opportunities as sighted people to access and enjoy sport and recreational activities in the UK. 

Starting from Gretna on the 18th July, he aims to have visited all 75 rounds and complete the challenge on Sunday 26th July at Berwick Rangers' Shielfield Park.
 
Not content with visiting each ground, John is jogging blindfold round each pitch. He estimates this will amount to over 1300 miles of driving and around 15 miles of blindfold jogging.
 
John called in at Dudgeon Park and completed his circuit of the pitch on Tuesday. We wish John all the best with his 9 day challenge ... and if you want to boost his fundraising for British Blind Sport, head on over to his [Just Giving page](https://www.justgiving.com/John-Latham3/)
