It's time to get the diaries and calendars dusted off and head over to our [Fixtures section](/fixtures/) for an early look at who meets who, where and when for the Press & Journal Scottish Highland Football Leage campaign next season.

It all kick's off for us down the road at Nairn County's Station Park on the 30th July. Our first home League game will be against Forres Mechanics on the 6th of August. Sandwiched neatly between these games will be our SPFL Challenge Cup game against ... well, we won't know that until the draw is made some time in early June.

Our Facebook Supporters Club page has been testament to the numbers of Cattach's missing the Dudgeon Park Saturday afternoon experience; so let the anticipation of another tightly contested League season begin.

Don't forget we have [pre-season action](/2016/05/14/pre-season-fixtures.html) starting on the 2nd of July if you want an early indication of how our new management team of Stuart and Grant intend to recapture the League Title ... and a good look at the new Brora Rangers kit!
