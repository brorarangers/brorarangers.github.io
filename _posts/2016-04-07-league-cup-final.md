It's the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup Final on Saturday 9th April at [Grant Street Park, Inverness](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Grant+St,+Inverness,+Highland+IV3+8BN/@57.4819233,-4.2321242,14.75z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x488f76ab6c3c639f:0x64571464518f306a). Brora Rangers face Nairn County in what promises to be an enthralling fixture. If you've missed our warm up to the final you could do worse than a quick read of our [Quarter Final](/2016/03/07/formartine-away-report.html), [Semi Final](http://brorarangers.football/2016/03/12/cove-home-report.html) match reports, and our customary articles building up to the game ... [Coincidence, Providence and Tenuous Links](/2016/04/04/the-final-countdown.html), [Heroes - Local, Highland and National](/2016/04/06/the-final-countdown.html) and finally, our [Match Preview](/2016/04/07/cup-final-preview.html).

There are no tickets for the game, just cash gates. With Inverness Caledonian Thistle playing away to Dundee Utd, Clachnacuddin themselves away to Formartine Utd, an expected big turn out from both the Nairn and Brora support and the draw of a big cup final for many neutral football fans, we expect a fair bit of congestion around the ground and advise arriving in plenty of time.

Ticket prices are £10.00 for adults, with £5.00 concessions and a further £2.00 for the stand.
