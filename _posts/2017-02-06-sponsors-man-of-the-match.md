In return for the excellent hospitality package our Match Sponsors were treated to on Saturday, they were left with one unenviable task.

On a day where the Brora squad responded in the best way possible to last weekend's disappointment at Fraserburgh, it fell to our guests to pick out a Man of the Match.

Gavin Morrison deservedly received that accolade this weekend, especially pleasing for him on his return for the Cattachs after a long spell of injury.

Despite the less than favourable weather conditions, our Match Sponsors were treated to an excellent meal before kick off, along with some pre match insights from our Assistant Manager, John Docherty, and luxury of half time refreshments well protected from the elements in our Sponsors Lounge.

It was back to the Lounge after the final whistle for the presentation of the Man of the Match award, and a memento for our sponsors.

We'd like to thank Tuckers Heroes and Finlayson & Gordon, Painters and Decorators for their support on Saturday.

This Saturday it's another home game for us, when we welcome Inverurie Loco Works back to Dudgeon Park for the 1st Round of the 2016-17 Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup. If you're interested in some VIP treatment for yourself and some guests, get in touch with [Russell](mailto:russell.jaffrey@btinternet.com).

We have more than match day entertainment to look forward to this spring too, with an evening catering exclusively for the ladies at the end of March, and a Golf Day in April. We'll have more details to follow, but keep up to date on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) accounts.
