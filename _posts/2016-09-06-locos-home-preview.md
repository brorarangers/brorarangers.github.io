Brora Rangers hope to keep their fantastic winning run firmly on track this Saturday as the Locos trundle into town.

Locos currently lie a lowly 13th in the League table, but that should fool nobody. They've taken a point home from their travels to Forres, Rothes and Wick; and only Turriff Utd have succeeded in beating them by more than a single goal. 

Locos manager, Scott Buchan, will be without Inverurie stalwart Kenny Coull by his side in the dugout this time round after Kenny's resignation at the end of last month. They have since signed former Aberdeen striker as a player/coach and we all know how a change in coaching staff can reignite a squads fortunes.

Despite cruising past the Locos on our way to lifting the Highland League Cup last season, they held us to a 1-1 draw on their last visit north. However, that was after a string of postponed matches due to the weather and two gruelling ties against Formartine Utd and Cove Rangers in the Quarter and Semi finals of the League Cup. This time round Brora are back to their imperious best.

The home goal at Dudgeon Park hasn't seen a ball cross the line since pre-season, whilst at the other end of the park we're running at an average of 5 goals per game in front of the home support.

It's always an important fixture for us, and more so this weekend ahead of our trip to Harmsworth Park the following Wednesday. Success breeds success ...

Elsewhere this weekend Buckie have an early kick-off against a Turriff Utd squad who showed an ability to dig in last weekend, and Cove Rangers and Formartine Utd go head to head at Harlaw Park. There may be some changes at the head of the table by 5pm.

We are certainly hoping for a headline regarding knocking the 'steam' out of the Inverurie outfit come Saturday evening.
