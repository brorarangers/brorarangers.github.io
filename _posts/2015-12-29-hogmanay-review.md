As 2015 draws to an end, it seems fitting that we should have a look back at our season so far. It's been a busy time for all at Brora Rangers Football Club, with many changes, not least of which is an effort to improve communication ... so settle down for a brief, and at times light hearted, look back before 2016 arrives.

Last season officially ended for Brora later than the rest of the Highland League with our historic Pyramid Playoffs against SPFL side Montrose, and our ultimate [defeat at Links Park](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32761228) on the 16th May. Whilst the squad didn't get much of a summer break before pre-season training started up again, there was also plenty going on behind the scenes in June too.

We'd already signed John Pickles right at the end of May, and Richard Brittain and Paul Brindle put pen to paper on the 6th June. Ally Macdonald and Connor Lyall followed close on their heels on the 20th of the month.

Meanwhile some of our fantastic fans were getting their sleeves rolled up and doing their own work on the pitch.

The obviously camera shy duo of Alister Matheson and James Macbeath set about the Dudgeon turf with a vengeance, assisting our ever present Groundsman, Sandy (Not to be confused with [Groundskeeper Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundskeeper_Willie)) in getting the pitch in tip top condition for the coming season.

Less camera shy, and arguably less skilled, but definitely no less willing were the infamous 'Painters 11' who turned out to freshen up the dressing rooms.

What a fantastic effort from those who swapped a Saturday watching the Brora Rangers for a Sunday watching the youngsters paint. There were others who missed out on the photo call, probably because they were actually doing some work, but throughout the close season supporters gave up their time to wield paint brushes and more around Dudgeon Park and we can't thank them enough for their dedication to the Club.

The 8th of June saw the ties for the North of Scotland Cup announced, with Brora drawn at home against Wick Academy in the first round. What a cracking fixture for our first competitive game of the new season.

By the end of June we had our pre-season friendlies sorted out and the Petrofac Cup draw saw us getting ready to face Championship side Alloa Athletic. So, no more hanging around ... and on the 1st of July we welcomed the Scottish Cup holders to the Dudgeon.

We can only assume that Inverness Caledonian Thistle had neither been dazzled with the freshly decorated away dressing room, nor affected by lingering paint fumes, as they scored in 14 minutes through Jordan Roberts. However, as the [Inverness Courier reported](http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/Sport/Football/Triallists-net-again-as-ICT-bag-Brora-win-01072015.htm) after the match:

*'The Cattachs, managed by former Raith Rovers man Davie Kirkwood, were not overawed by the opposition and responded well to going behind. Wedderburn had to be alert to flick away a teasing Andy Greig cross and Ryan Esson stood tall to block an effort from Paul Brindle, making his first Brora appearance since moving from Clach.'*

*'Looking to get a foothold in the game, the two-time Highland League champions came close to reducing the deficit on the hour. Greig cut back inside on his right foot and stood the ball up to the back post for Colin Maclean, whose first-time effort rolled narrowly wide.'*

![Richie Brittain makes his debut as Player/Coach for Brora Rangers against ICT]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-4.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Brora's starting line up gave the Cattach's their first look at our new signings, and they didn't fail to impress. We'd seen Paul Brindle and John Pickles play against us before and the fans had an idea of what to expect from the speedy pair, but what seemed to impress the spectators most was the clever link up play between player/coach Brittain and Zander.

It wasn't to be, however, and the game finished with a 0-3 victory to the SPL side as they prepared themselves for their first game in the Europa League. 

Three days later we travelled through to Aberdeen for a match against Woodside AFC. Young Connor Lyall was rewarded with his first start for the Reds, and with Chubbs, Zander, Richie, Sid, Gavin and Scott Houston all starting on the bench there was an obvious desire to impress and claim a place in the regular starting line up. Scott Graham was first to do his thing with a goal in 8 minutes, followed by his second 4 minutes later. It took until almost 20 minutes for the next goal to arrive, with an equaliser from Woodside, soon prompting the entrance of firstly Chubbs and Sid, and shortly after Zander and Richie Brittain. In the 80th minute Zander popped the ball in the net, followed less than a minute later by another from Chubbs. Paul Brindle scored his debut Brora goal in the 84th minute to give us a 5-1 victory at full time.

Next up were Greenock Morton, Jim Duffy's side getting ready for a season in the Scottish Championship after their promotion from League 1. Clachnacuddin had held the Cappielow outfit to a goaless draw a couple of days previously during Morton's whistle-stop tour of the North.

The Greenock Telegraph carried [an excellent report](http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/sport/14020289.REPORT__Brora_0_Morton_1/) of the match, showing that the 0-1 scoreline could have easily been a creditable draw if chances from either Zander, Brittain or Brindle had come off. As it was, Stefan McLuskey's 64th minute strike was destined to separate the two teams.

The following week saw some major off field changes at Brora Rangers Football Club. David Kirkwood, the manager who led the Cattach's through their most successful period of history to date, announced his resignation. We reported at the time ...

*' David Kirkwood has regrettably decided to resign his position as Manager of Brora Rangers Football Club.*
 
*He has taken this decision to allow him to concentrate fully on launching his business venture.*
 
*Chairman John Young, on behalf of the Board, would like to take this opportunity to thank David for leading the Club during the most successful period in our history. He added that there would always be a warm welcome at the club for Davy and he will always be fondly remembered for the tremendous amount he achieved.*
 
*David said that he agonised over this most difficult decision and he wished the Club every success and would always remain a supporter. He would also like to thank all the coaching and supporty staff as well as all the players who have been there during his venture. '*

With the real action about to start, some quick footwork was also evident from those who work behind the scenes. Our experience of the Pyramid Playoff at the end of last season had given us an invaluable insight into the demands which would be placed on any club moving up into the SPFL. Brora Rangers FC made no bones about it, we aimed to retain our Highland League Championship and go one step further than our previous record breaking season. A new Board was formed to develop our strategy and direction and to work alongside our current Committee. 

The first public statement from the new Board was the appointment of Richard Brittain as our new Player/Manager.

*'Richieâ€™s experience in top flight football combined with his leadership abilities will be invaluable to the team as we defend our Highland League title.*

*Davie Kirkwood will be a very difficult act to follow, but we believe we have the right man to help us deliver our ambitions of going forward into the SPFL.'*

That left us with one final Saturday before we headed into two big Cup games, and on the 18th July we welcomed League 2 side Clyde to Dudgeon Park. Despite a goal in 2 minutes from Zander the last time we met the Bully Wee, in our 2013 Scottish Cup campaign, the Broadwood lads ran out 2-1 victors. Richie had one chance to to get into the swing of his new role before we met Wick Academy in our defence of the NoS Cup.

Despite the 0-0 final score, this was a terrific contest between two well matched sides, with Zander, Paul Brindle, Ally Macdonald, Gavin and Sid all threatening the Clyde goal; and Brisbane and Higgins keeping Joe on his toes to earn a clean sheet.

And that was it. The 2015/16 pre-season was over. For our new manager and the squad, it was time to get ready for what was bound to be a tough start to the competitive season. Behind the scenes we were looking further forward, and part of that was a revamp of our match day programmes and website.

On the playing side, what a start it was. A derby game at home to start the defence of the AJG Parcels North of Scotland Cup. What a game! Along with our own [Official Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) account to keep those unable to make the games up to date, our Supporters Club attempt to keep the members on their Facebook page as well informed of the big games as possible. They even have a 'Golden Mic' award for the best reporter ...

That's the 2014/15 award winner. His first report of the new season didn't bode well. Despite faithful followers showing their confidence in his ability to retain his title ...

... it was looking like the Golden Mic would be heading elsewhere this season ...

![Poor reporting from the Golden Mic ...]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-9.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

That was his last appearance until 11pm. Chick Young, eat your heart out.

Fortunately our Official Twitter feed kept everyone up to date, and we had to have busy fingers for a non stop, end to end action packed game worthy of the event.

Captain Steven Mackay scored the first goal with a header from Richie Brittain's corner in the 23rd minute, and that was the way it stayed for the remainder of the first half. Brora came out firing on all cylinders in the 2nd half but Wick were beginning to look ever more threatening as the game wore on, and Davie Allan got a deserved equaliser 5 minutes from full time. No extra time in the NoS Cup, so it was straight to penalties.

No need to go into too much detail here, we know the North of Scotland Cup isn't sitting in the corner anymore, we know it's up the road at Harmsworth Park. We'll talk about the Cup Final later, but for now, let's just move on. Thanks.

It was straight back into Cup action again on the following Saturday against Alloa Athletic. The Scottish Championship side won the trophy (Then the "Bell's Challenge Cup") back in 1999 and were runners up to Livingston last season. 

The match report is [here](/2015/07/27/petrofac_cup.html). It was the first of our new match reports and was an early taste of the plans we had for a greater degree of communication between the Club and supporters. Just as well really, as the Man with the Golden Mic failed to show up on Facebook again ... Our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) kept the armchair fans informed as the game unfolded though. 

A defeat is never easy to take, but the second half performance was especially pleasing, and those who watched the game left with a bigger spring in their steps than is usually the case when being on the losing side.

Whilst our Cup involvement wasn't over, it was time to get started on the defence of our second League title. Due to our involvement in the Petrofac Training Cup, our opening game of the 2015/16 Highland League against Lossiemouth was moved to the Wednesday evening. True to form, and in a staggering display of dereliction of duty, we believe the Golden Mic didn't even turn up to this game. However, in stepped the next contender for the role. Let's call him *George*. 

*George* is well known to all the regular Brora Rangers support, he rarely misses a game, home or away. *George* is one of the younger members of our support, but he doesn't let that get in the way of getting involved at every opportunity. *George*, along with our Twitter updates, came to the rescue of the armchair fans on that Wednesday night. The original [match report](/2015/07/30/lossie-away-report.html) was posted on our website the following day, Brora had returned home with the 3 points from a 0-3 victory, and all was well with the world.

At last, we headed towards the 1st of August and our first home League game of 2015. Flag Day. 

![John Young and Ben Mackay prepare to raise the League Flag for the second season in a row at Dudgeon Park]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-11.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

We were really getting into our stride now, both on the pitch, with an 11-0 victory over Rothes, and off the pitch with big steps towards producing our new look Match Programme and ever increasingly informative website [match reports](/2015/08/04/rothes-home-report.html).

Over on the Supporters Club updates, things had reached an all time low ...

![Possibly the poorest match update ever]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-13.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Thanks also have to go to the Mackessack Park '59 Club, who endeavoured to remind us that we aren't the only team to proudly fly a league flag ...

![The Rothes away support help the Dudgeo Park supporters keep their feet on the ground on Flag Day]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-12.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Talking of proud histories, it was also brought to our attention a few days later that the 5th of August was the anniversary of Glasgow Celtic buying [Roddy MacDonald](http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/MacDonald,+Roddie) from Brora Rangers in 1972.

One of our ex-players remembered the occasion well,

*"We played Huntly away and on the road home Roddy and Sammy Wilson got of the bus in Inverness to meet the Celtic boss in the Station Hotel"*

On the 7th of August we announced that Colin Maclean would be joining Clachnacuddin FC on loan, originally until the 20th December. Colin is a young man who joined our under 15 squad back in 2012 - and scored a hat-trick on his debut. Supporters will no doubt remember him best for his fantastic [6 goal bonanza](http://www.highland-news.co.uk/Sport/Football/Fort-William-FC/Brora-Rangers-teenager-hits-six-on-debut-at-Fort-William-14092014.htm) at Claggan Park on his debut start for the first team back in November 2014. It's a measure of how competitive a striker's position is at Dudgeon Park these days

Next up in our early fixtures were Buckie Thistle at Victoria Park, and the goals just kept on coming. It's a happy band that follow Brora around the Highland League grounds every season, and it's nice to see some of our favourite haunts are just as glad to see us,

![Fochabers Ice Cream shop look forward to the Brora support's visit]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-14.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Our Twitter feed was busy trying to keep up with the action as Zander, Sid and Paul rattled 5 goals in between them by half time. Zander completed his hat-trick in the second half, while Sid went one better. Over on Facebook, the boy we're calling *George* was busy working his way into contention for the Golden Mic.

![The Brora fans enjoying a sunny afternoon in Buckie]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-15.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

We don't want to give too much away here, but *George* is in this photo from the Buckie game, looking very nonchalant for a match reporter, as others who have tried keeping the Facebook thread updated will testify.

Not everyone could make the trip to Buckie this season, as our Marketing Department were at Belladrum.

It was back to Dudgeon Park to host Keith for our fourth game of the current League campaign, and our [match report](/2015/08/17/keith-home-report.html) records a stiffer test than we'd met so far. However, the lads dug in, and it turned into 'the Zander and Chubbs show' to finish in a 4-1 victory.

Despite the early disappointment of the North of Scotland Cup defeat, the squad really seemed to have a grip of League business by this stage. Next up were Cove Rangers, obviously one of the challengers for the 2015/16 title, and a team that had impressed at the Dudgeon the previous season.

Off the park everything appeared to be moving in the right direction too, our new Match Programmes were improving with every home game and were well received by the supporters; the team sheets distributed before Kick Off with a poster for the next Home game were quickly snapped up and we felt our new website was very close to being ready for it's public launch.

All in all, it seems like a great place to take a break from our end of year review. Remember to come back tomorrow for Part 2!
