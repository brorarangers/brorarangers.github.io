The Highland League campaign is over, and our 2016-17 season will come to a close after our North of Scotland Cup Final on the 20th May. You can all have a short, but well earned break.

Don't stop keeping an eye on here, though.

The fixtures for 2017/18 Press & Journal Highland League will be issued on Monday 29th May. Included in these dates will be dates for the SPFL Challenge Cup, Scottish Cup, SHFL League Cup and the North of Scotland FA Cup.

There will also be the inevitable movement of players in and out of our squad, which Rss is busy working on at the moment.

Add to that some tasty pre season fixtures, updates from the Brora Rangers Improvement Trust, news from our Youth Development team ... the website will be far from dormant until July.
