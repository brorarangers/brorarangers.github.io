Due to our planned tie against Formartine falling foul of the weather last weekend, we now make another attempt to travel to Formartine Utd's North Lodge Park for our Quarter Final of the Highland League Cup on Saturday 5th March rather than hosting Huntly at home.

The Supporters Cub have already organised a bus for this match - the usual prices of £20 for members and £23 for non members. The winners of this game will meet Cove Rangers at home in a semi final spot.

The weather forecast still looks promising for our home game against Fort William on Wednesday 2nd March and the squad will be itching to get back to competitive football after the recent postponements.
