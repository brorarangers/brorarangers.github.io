Brora Rangers can announce the transfer of Andrew Greig to Formartine United for an undisclosed fee.

Speaking of his move Andrew said, "It is with a heavy heart that I call time on an incredible five and half years with Brora Rangers Football Club. I felt like it was time for a new challenge in my career and to prove myself elsewhere. I can't thank the board, players, staff and supporters enough for having the faith in me and helping achieve unprecedented success. I wish the club all the very best success in the future".

On behalf of the Club Chairman William Powrie thanked Andrew for his contributions and efforts and commented, "Andrew has had a wonderful time at Dudgeon Park and as a member of the double League winning side has scored many important goals for us. He felt it was a time for a move, and it is change which keeps us all alive. We were able to agree terms with Formartine United and it goes without saying that everybody at Brora Rangers wishes Andrew all the best for his future."
