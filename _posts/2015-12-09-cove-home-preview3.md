It's one of these weeks for Brora Rangers supporters. Families are probably not getting all the attention they deserve, the odd mistake is creeping into work, TV news is being watched, but not really paid attention to. Shopping in the local Co-op takes that little bit longer than usual as the aisles seemed clogged up with people not totally concentrating on the shopping list.

Like many youngsters will be doing closer to the end of the month, the Cattachs are almost wishing the week away ... how many sleeps to Saturday??

There's no doubt about it, whilst the Highland league season consists of 17 home and 17 away games, some games are bigger than others. This is going to be a big game. This could be our biggest game ... this could be Cove's biggest game. This game will play a huge part in how the 2015/16 Highland League finishes for both teams.

No pressure, then.

OK, some pressure. Both sides have shown throughout the season they have the ability to go out and dominate games, both sides have demonstrated the ability to dig in and grind out the tougher results when it matters. Both squads are too professional to let one game define their season.

Confidence is high in the Brora camp. Training is going well and results since our last meeting at Harlaw Park show a side which has gelled well and adapted to changes at the start of the season.

All we really need now is **you**. It's back to the old 'home turf' situation, and the biggest advantage the lads can have is a noisy, partisan crowd backing them for 90 minutes.

So, Dudgeon Park in amongst the super friendly Red Army watching the League's top two sides battle it out for the 3 points ... or battling your way around the busy, bustling shops in Inverness laden down with bags and losing any Christmas cheer before it even arrived?

We have something for your weekend, come and join us!
