The last time Forres Mechanics came to Dudgeon Park they were riding high on the back of 5 straight wins. Morale was high and they travelled north with what must have been a fair degree of confidence in taming the Cattachs.

Six unanswered goals from a hard working Brora squad well and truly put paid to the Can Cans unbeaten run ... including a header from Forres new boy Scott Graham.

Forres have had a good start to their League campaign with a one all draw against Inverurie Locos. There can be few complaints with the start Brora have made to our season, with a commanding opening win and progression to the 2nd Round of the Irn-Bru Cup under our belts so far. This Satarday it will be a case of ensuring the Cattachs can, and the Can Cans can't.

... And our obligatory weather forecast? Leave the umbrellas at home.
