Some people get involved in Regional Cup Finals, and find them somewhat addictive. Some people get involved in Regional Cup Finals for a reason. They have the management and coaching ability to take a squad into these games.

Cue Kevin Munro.

Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the appointment of Kevin as Assistant Team Manager ahead of our North of Scotland Cup Final. Kevin was at last season's final as part of the Fort William management team. He could easily have been at this season's final as part of the Lossiemouth management team.

But we are delighted Kevin is going to be at Grant Street Park at the weekend as part of our management team.

Ross Tokely commented, "I am delighted welcome Kevin Munro on board after his time at Lossiemouth FC. He is a great addition to the team and the club. Myself and the players are looking forward to working with him  more in the future and we all welcome him to the Club. It took a bit of time to find the right candidate after John Docherty left, so I feel we have found someone who has a good knowledge of the Highland League and he has already impressed in his short time at the club. To have someone like Kevin who is keen to coach is vital to the club going forward."
