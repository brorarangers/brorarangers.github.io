Brora Rangers tonight confirmed that Colin Maclean is to join Clachnacuddin FC on loan until the 20th December 2015.

Colin is a strong attacking player with a good turn of pace, never demonstrated better than in last season's final play off match against Montrose where his goal pulled Brora level minutes into the second half.
