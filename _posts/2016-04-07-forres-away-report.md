Every Brora player on the park this evening, has played themselves into contention for a place in the Highland League Cup Final against Nairn County at Grant Street Park on Saturday.

On a foul wintery like night, Brora handled the near waterlogged conditions the better, and in the end ran out comfortable winners 3-0.

The first half was a physical affair with the home side having the better of the chances, but keeper Martin was never really troubled.  At the other end Forres keeper McIntosh made some good saves from Mackay and Sutherland.

The second half saw Brora dominate proceedings and goals from Sutherland, Mackay and Graham sealed the victory.

Player Manager Brittain put his stamp on midfield, well supported by a workmanlike Scotty Graham with Sid Mackay always looking dangerous up front.
