There has been a youthful feel around the Club recently, both with recent visitors and from our own Youth Development efforts.

Saturday saw the visit of the Aberdeen U20s to Dudgeon Park and last night we met Ross County's Development Squad. A Monday evening trip to Lairg saw our own Development Squad stretch their legs and give both Ross and our travelling support an exiting look at some of our youngsters who are looking forward to their coming season.

Before any of these matches took place, however, we had our most youthful event. The inaugural Brora Rangers Primary School Championship.

The tournament pitted Brora, Helmsdale and Golspie Primary Schools against each other, to which Golspie Primary ran out winners. On what was a fantastic morning, all schools were well supported by parents, families & friends.

On the success of the tournament Brora Rangers Head of Youth Development, Dale Pryde-MacDonald, was delighted, “It was a truly monumental day for the club. We had a great tournament, which was really well-attended by parents and families and made the day really special for the kids, and for the club too.”

“It was incredible to not only see the kids and families come along to the tournament but also see them stay for the match at 3pm. There was a brilliant vibe around the whole place from about 10.30am to 5pm - a feeling that no money can buy”

Thanks were given to George MacKenzie, who refereed the tournament and also to first team players James Ross and John Pickles who spent the morning at the tournament and presented the winning team with their certificates.

The tournament was created and organised on the back of plans that Dale has for the next school year. The Club has a real desire to strengthen and grow our connection with local children and communities which you can expect to hear more about over the summer.

Dale and his team will be conducting trials for the U17 and U20 squads tonight at Dudgeon Park. Keep your eyes on the [Youth Development Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Brora-Rangers-Youth-Development-706933956103798/) for all their announcements.
