With the completion of the Breedon League Cup semi final matches on Tuesday evening, League Secretary, Rod Houston, has released some updated fixtures for March and April.

Of our 11 outstanding games we are now scheduled to welcome Turriff Utd to Dudgeon Park on Saturday 31st March, with Wick Academy making the short trip down the road on the following Wednesday evening. Our scheduled end of season meeting with Cove Rangers remains on the calendar for Saturday 14th April.

After our trip to Rothes this Saturday we will travel to Nairn the following Wednesday evening, with Saturday the 7th of April set aside for a trip to Inverurie and an evening trip to meet Strathspey Thistle on Wednesday 11th.

That just leaves us looking for a date to travel to Turriff, and space to complete our home games against Deveronvale, Fraserburgh and Huntly to complete our 2017-18 League campaign.

There is certainly plenty left to play for this season as we look to force our way as high up the table as possible with an eye on the rewards next season's national Cup competitions can bring.
