According to [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Dudgeon+Park,+Brora+KW9+6QH,+United+Kingdom/Wick+Academy+Football+Club,+Harmsworth+Park,+South+Road,+Wick,+Highland+KW1+5NH,+United+Kingdom/@58.2412957,-3.7579201,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x48855eeef62f1c0f:0x74fc14a9273fb345!2m2!1d-3.859619!2d58.0085117!1m5!1m1!1s0x489ad6a5954b4969:0xff79d97d0f54e232!2m2!1d-3.0930114!2d58.4327147!3e0) there are only 46 miles between Dudgeon Park and Harmsworth Park. According to the Highland League Table there are 25 points separating the two sides. According to the stats Brora have taken all 3 points home from our last two visits to Wick. According to tradition, this is one of our most anticipated trips of the season.

Not only highly anticipated, but recently extremely tight affairs. Our slender lead at the top of the table as we head into this meeting all adds to the prospect of yet another memorable Derby Day.

A couple of bad days at the Wick office back in 2012, but nothing that can't be made up for on Saturday afternoon.

The Brora squad have an admirable away record this season, one loss early in the season to Cove Rangers, a huge comeback last Saturday to earn a draw against Formartine Utd, and a bus trip home with the 3 points secured from every other ground in the league so far ... with only Harmsworth Park and Mosset Park to visit. Wick have capitulated to Buckie, Clachnacuddin, Cove, Deveronvale and Formartine on their home turf this season.

Whilst we are looking at statistics, Wick have scored an average of 2.62 goals per game at home in the league this season, conceding 1.12. Brora have an impressive 4.4 average goals scored per game away from home, with a corresponding 1.27 conceded. If past records and recent statistics were enough to secure points, the Brora supporters would be heading up the A9 with an unshakable confidence.

To be fair, our fantastic support arrive at most games with an unshakable confidence. As the last few remaining fixtures of the season roll in the pressure to take the full points from every game increases though. Not just on us. And whilst we are obviously keeping an eye on our closest rivals for the title, not for any other team either. There is pride to be played for in every Highland League fixture. And when it comes to pride, the Derby games sit right at the top of every Club's list.

A few scenes like this from our last meeting with our neighbours ...

... can keep our hopes alive, a 3rd consecutive Scottish Highland League title and a 5th League Winner's medal firmly in Zander's sights!

There will be a degree of confidence in the Caithness camp as we approach this fixture. A narrow defeat to Formartine Utd and a 4-2 win over Inverurie Locos in recent weeks. Though this will be tempered with the memory of a 1-3 defeat at the hands of an understrength Buckie Thistle.

Brora are going to have to bring their 'A game' to Harmsworth Park; last Saturday's second half Brora, the League Cup SF Brora, the League Cup QF closing 20 minutes, extra time, Brora. The closing 20 minutes of Wednesday's narrow home win Brora will definitely need to give this trip a miss.

Next Wednesday sees a trip to Mosset Park for ourselves, whilst Cove Rangers meet Formartine at Harlaw Park - the outcome of those games are incredibly important to our challenge, but only if we come home over The Ord with all 3 points this Saturday.

**46 miles. The shortest trip in our travelling calendar. Let's fill Harmsworth Park with a sea of Red and White in one of the most important Derby Days of recent seasons.**
