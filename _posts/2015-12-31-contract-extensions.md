Club Chairman, John Young, was absolutely delighted at securing the pair on renewed contracts. He commented "We are very pleased that Paul and Zander see their future with Brora Rangers. Both are key personnel within the playing squad and feel that the club's future plans and its desire to progress is compatible with their own ambitions." 

Player Manager Richard Brittain commented "I'm delighted that both of these two key players are committing to the club. Paul is an exciting talent who has been a prolific goal scorer this season. He is still learning and is certainly in the right place to progress his career. Zander is an established member of our squad and brings a great deal of experience to the dressing room. He is a proven winner and a leader, with 4 Highland League titles already in his locker, and in big games he often makes all the difference. He's a local  boy which makes his success even more the sweeter."

Paul Brindle (23) had no hesitation in signing for 3 years. "I'm at the best team in the Highland League, and was delighted to extend my contract. I'm very happy at the terms and conditions and hopefully I can develop and go on to bring Brora future success and honours."

A beaming Zander Sutherland was also delighted to extend his contact. "I've won 4 titles and I'm determined  not only to make it 5, but also be part of this progressive club as they hopefully move up to higher levels." 

Board Member and principle club sponsor, Ben Mackay, was very pleased that the contract negotiations went so smoothly. "We were anxious to secure the services of these two players on longer term deals, and they were both delighted to pledge their future to the club. We have now most of our squad on long term agreements and this is our commitment to our fans and sponsors of the great desire to develop the club and take it onto the next level." 

"Both players are lovely lads and are game winners, and we as a club are determined to drive progress in all club activities. We are back where we want to be, and Paul and Zander's contribution and goals will be critical as we enter the business end of the season" said Ben.
