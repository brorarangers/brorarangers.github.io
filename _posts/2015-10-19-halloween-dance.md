Our very own Donnie and his partner in crimes against music are all set to raise the roof of the Social Club on Saturday 31st October for a Halloween Special.

The lads never fail to entertain with their set list, and are bound to have some special songs up their sleeve for the Brora fans ... including their own tribute to last season's League Championship winning squad.

Starting at 8pm, the duo will be playing until 11:45pm. Strictly for Over 18s and all for £5.00 payable at the door, it's well worth putting some effort into your Halloween costume as there's a prize for the best dressed on the night.

The night is one of the major fund raising events for the Brora Rangers Supporters Club, ultimately helping support the Football Club. Last weekend the Supporters Cub donated £200.00 to our Youth Development Teams, who are currently seeking [sponsorship](/2015/10/15/youth-team-sponsorship.html) to help buy new kits and equipment. At the start of the season they financed training kit for the First Team and in the past donated money to help upgrade the PA system at Dudgeon Park. The Supporters Club also runs buses to away matches, helping to ensure support for the team - something the players seldom fail to let us know can make a huge difference in their quest to retain our position at the top of the table.

Ronnie 'n' Donnie are also organising a raffle in aid of Moray Firth Radio's 'Cash for Kids', if you want to donate a prize get in touch with them through their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ronnien.donnie) 

So get your Fancy Dress sorted out, treat yourselves to a night of Brora Rangers favourite troubadours, support the Supporters Club that supports your team and raise some money for Cash for Kids. A great night out with no drawbacks.
