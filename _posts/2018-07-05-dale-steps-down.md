Due to increased work commitments Dale Pryde-MacDonald is to step down from his role as Head of Youth Development. 

Dale explained “Due to a change in my work circumstances I am going to have to give up the role as there are going to be increased demands on my time meaning a great deal less time available to the club.

I am frustrated after a really good trials event at the weekend but unfortunately my work does have to come first.”

On behalf of the club, Chairman William Powrie thanked Dale for his past efforts and the great platform which he has built, to promote and develop the youth teams. “Dale’s decision to focus on his professional career is fully understood, and we all wish him well with his new venture.”

Dales departure will mean that the club will realign reporting structures, but are absolutely committed to maintaining a development youth policy. We will commence our search for Dale’s replacement(s) immediately.
