Brora Rangers turned up at Station Park in Forfar with few changes on the pitch, a depleted bench, a minimal support, and the attitude worthy of a Club hungry for success.

If the aim of a pre-season friendly match is to give the squad a chance to sharpen up as a unit before the real campaigns start, then Grant Munro and his team must feel that Saturday afternoon was a case of 'Mission Accomplished'.

If the small travelling support were looking for an escape from the Euro 2016 drudgery, then they will have travelled home happy.

For their first game in the run up to the 2016/17 season the Brora team looked alert and keen, but it was Forfar's Jim Lister who broke the deadlock in the 58th minute. In typical Cattachs style the lads quickly fought back and a Martin Maclean drive was neatly turned past the stranded Forfar keeper by Steven Mackay 4 minutes later.

Jim Lister rose above the Brora defence to head a free kick past Joe Malin in the 70th minute as Forfar's superior match fitness began to show, and despite efforts from both sides that was how the scoreline finished.

The SPFL opponents certainly knew they were involved in a competitive game, and Forfar officials paid tribute to the squads professionalism. The coming P&J Highland League season will be competitive, but Brora Rangers have everything to look forward to. 

That's the first of our pre-season games done and dusted, and now attention will be focused on Dudgeon Park where we host Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Tuesday 5th July.

The future is bright ... the future is Brora Rangers!
