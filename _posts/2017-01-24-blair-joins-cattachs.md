Tough tackling, midfield playmaker Blair Maclennan has undertaken a loan spell with Brora Rangers from Caley Thistle.

Blair, who played for Brora "informally" against Inverness Caley Thistle last week, was delighted at the prospect of his move to Dudgeon Park. "I enjoyed the game the other week, and I'm looking forward to playing with what seems a great club and a great bunch of players. I do hope that I can add value to the team"

A beaming Ross Tokely has been impressed with Blair and welcomed his move to the club. "With all still to play for, we were worried that injuries and suspensions to our midfield could cost us dear. Blair is a terrier in the middle and will fulfil a great role for us"

Blair will be available for selection against Fraserburgh this Saturday.
