Brora Rangers put together their performance of the season when they trounced Nairn County 7-1 at Station Park on Wednesday evening.


Earlier in the same day Yorkshire County Cricket Club won the County Championship for a second consecutive season. 

Speaking after his side clinched the title, cricket director Martyn Moxon complimented his team and put their success down to two simple things; working hard on the training ground and having a full squad with strength in depth. 

The similarities between Yorkshire CCC and Brora Rangers are there to be seen, and never moreso than on Wednesday evening. 

It was a cold autumnal night but Brora were red hot and Cattach supports left the ground buzzing after watching football of the very highest quality. 

Nairn started the match in high tempo and Githins had a shot narrowly miss the target, but that was to be the only serious assault on the Brora goal until the dying minutes of the match. 

Steven Mackay opened the scoring after 13 mins and despite having 80% of the play and a dozen chances there were no further goals in the first half.

Brora really turned on the tap after the break and Dale Gillespie added the second with a wonder drive after 55 minutes. He received the ball at least 10 yards outside the penalty box and the first the keeper knew about it was when it hit the back of the net.

The Nairn keeper was dispatched for a second early bath of the season after bringing down Steven Mackay and the poor reserve keeper Dylan Maclean got his first touch of the ball, when he picked it out of the net after Ritchie Brittain converted the spot kick. Worse was to come-much worse!

Maclean's second touch was again to retrieve the ball from the onion bag after Sutherland netted, and his third touch was again to pick the ball out of the goal when Brindle made it 5-0. 

The home fans began to leave the ground early and there was a considerable amount of discontent aimed at the Nairn bench and in particular towards their Manager Les Fridge with demands for him to go. 

Paul Brindle was electric on the night  and the Nairn defence never got to grips with his pace. He completed his hat-trick within 3 minutes as the scoreboard rolled onto 7-0

John Cameron pulled one back for Nairn, but this was a performance of the highest quality from Brora Rangers who continued with their flowing passing build up, and the training ground preparations were seen to great effect. 

Richard Brittain's attention to detail was evident as Brora held their shape throughout the match and never allowed a normally tricky Nairn County side get into their stride. Munro and Houston won almost every ariel ball and Ally MacDonald was so very effective as a full back and equally so on all of his many surging runs forward. 

The entire Brora team never stopped running or working throughout the game and the whole unit looks and plays as if at ease with itself. 

All eyes now turn to Saturday where Brora Rangers entertain [Formartine United at Dudgeon Park](/2015/09/10/formartine-home-preview.html) in what will be a crucial game at the head of the Highland League table.
