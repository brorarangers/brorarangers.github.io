Brora Rangers put together their performance of the season when they trounced Nairn County 7-1 at Station Park on Wednesday evening.


It was a cold autumnal night but Brora were red hot and Cattach supports left the ground buzzing after watching football of the very highest quality.

Steven Mackay opened the scoring after 13 mins and despite having 80% of the play,there were no further goals in the first half.

Brora really turned on the Tap after the break and Dale Gillespie added the second with a wonder drive after 55 minutes.

The Nairn keeper was dispatched for an early bath after bringing down Steven Mackay and the poor reserve keeper Dylan Maclean got his first touch of the ball, when he picked it out of the net after Ritchie Brittain converted the spot kick. Worse was to come!

Maclean's second touch was again to retrieve the ball from the onion bag after Sutherland netted, and his third touch was again to pick the ball out of the goal when Brindle made it 5-0.

Paul Brindle was electric as he completed his hat-trick in 3 minutes as the scoreboard clicked onto 7-0

John Cameron pulled one back for Nairn, but this was a performance of the highest quality from Brora Rangers and a great way to go forward into the Formartine game on Saturday.
