First held in the 1873, the Scottish Cup is the oldest national trophy in the world. That's quite a claim. It's *the* tournament where every Club can dare to dream, and the underdog frequently has his day.

Whether it was East Fife winning the tournament back in 1938 whilst still in Division 2, Fraserburgh eliminating Dundee in 1959, Berwick Rangers beating Glasgow Rangers in 1967, Stenhousemuir putting Aberdeen out in 1995 and the headline making Super Caley Go Ballistic match against Celtic in 2000. Every game is there for the taking.

Brora Rangers first taste of the Scottish Cup was in the 1955/56 season, losing 5-1 to Eyemouth Utd who were the current East of Scotland League Champions at the time ... and the seasons on either side of our meeting. 

The following season Brora travelled down to Wigton & Bladenoch to record a 1-4 victory and progress into the 2nd round against ... well, more of that later.

We didn't return to Scottish Cup duty until 1972/73 where a 2nd round defeat at home to Hamilton Academical gave us an early exit and the Accies a moment of brightness in a tough period of their history as they made it through to a replay in the 4th round, narrowly missing out on a quarter final spot.

1979/80 saw Brora in replay action too, holding Buckie to a scoreless draw at Victoria Park before losing 1-2 in the return fixture at Dudgeon Park.

Our next Cup appearances are still fresh in the mind of many supporters and ex-players ... 1982/83 saw Brora travel down to Selkirk and returned with a 0-2 victory and progression into the next round. It's not that we try to make a habit of meeting Angus Clubs, but Montrose had to travel to Dudgeon Park. Unlike their more recent visit, they held Brora to a 0-0 draw forcing a replay at Links Park. The replay ended 1-1, in those days forcing a second replay back in Brora. The Cattachs ensured progression with a convincing 5-2 win, setting us up for the chance to really Defy the Odds against Dundee FC.

Dundee had a few familiar names in the squad ... but then again, so did Brora.

More of the legendary trip to Dens Park another day, tales of such adventure and drama deserve more than a footnote in an article about our current campaign. More too about our subsequent Scottish Cup exploits in subsequent posts, as it's time to return to our Cup run of 1956/57.

Following the monster trip to Wigton, and those who made the trip to Palmerston Park in Dumfries with the advantage of the Dornoch and Kessock Bridges, improved A9 and goodness knows what other road improvements south of Perth, will appreciate the magnitude of *that* journey, Brora received yet another away draw.

Away to a side that finished their season slap bang in the middle of the then Second Division, a side with a ground even closer to the North Sea than our own.

Arbroath FC finished that season ahead of Dundee Utd, St Johnstone and their local rivals Montrose. Arbroath FC skelped Brora Rangers 6-1 to dump us out of the Cup.

There's history here, wrongs to be righted. Brora Rangers will be looking for revenge on Saturday.

We have a gentleman here who likes to get his hands on a Cup or two, rumour has it he was too young for the first Arbroath Cup game, and may not make the bench for this one. But he had a habit of collecting Cups, trophies and victories in between. He'll be looking for a reversal of the 1956 scoreline. Get yourself up to Dudgeon Park on Saturday afternoon, stand shoulder to shoulder with your fellow Cattachs, and let's roar Brora Rangers into the next round of the William Hill Scottish Cup for yet another season.
