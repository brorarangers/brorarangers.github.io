Spaces for our fantastic Matchday Hospitality are filling up, and no wonder given the effort we put in to providing you with an afternoon to remember.

Kicking off with a complimentary bar before sitting down to a 3 course meal and then into the match with your Team Sheet and Match Programme. Half time is spent in our Executive Lounge with hot drinks and yet more food to sustain you through the second half. 

Returning to the Executive Lounge at full time for more complimentary drinks and the obligatory post match analysis rounds off an excellent afternoon.

At £65.00 per person, we feel it is excellent value. Don't forget we've also introduced a Boardroom Hospitality package this season including pre and post match drinks in the Boardroom along with half time fayre, all for £30.00 per person.
