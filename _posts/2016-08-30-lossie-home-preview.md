On Wednesday night Lossiemouth come calling to Dudgeon Park. An unbeaten Lossiemouth. A Lossiemouth that have conceded a miserly single goal in 5 games.

A new season is always an exciting time as the work done behind the scenes within the Highland League clubs during the short close season comes to fruition. Let's face it, there are a few clubs in our league who must be very pleased with the fruits of their labours, buying, selling, training and planning as we head into our 6th game of the 2016-17 season.

Our old friend Rab, along with his Committee and Charlie Charlesworth must be very satisfied with the start to their season. Sitting 3rd in the league table with victories over Wick Academy, Inverurie Loco Works and Turriff Utd already secured, an opening season victory over a vastly improved Rothes and a draw against a Huntly team who showed last weekend they are no walkover, Lossie are, without a doubt, on a winning streak.

However, they are not the only ones. We've worked hard over our close season too, and that has been evident on the park. A quick look back through the post match interviews on the Press and Journal 'Big Game' highlights let even the casual observer see that Grant and Steven demand more than a win on match day. Brora Rangers are more than prepared both on and off the pitch to fly the League Champions flag at Dudgeon Park again, and go one better than our inaugural Pyramid Playoff for entry to the SPFL League 2 attempt.

In League business we've only conceded one more goal than The Coasters, and that was against a Cove side that Lossie have yet to meet. Our IRN-BRU Cup game against Peterhead showed that we can play our best football when faced with a real challenge. No doubt about it, the League Table doesn't lie, but it can flatter to deceive this early in the season.

Mid week games can be a problem for the travelling support especially, but we've checked with the Met Office - as usual, we're sharing the same bright and warm weather system as the Moray coast and expecting a braw evening for football.

Don't be fooled by Lossie's temporary position above us in the League table, but don't be fooled by the recent results either. This is a big game, this promises to be an exciting game, this is the night both Cove Rangers and ourselves hope to burst the Moray bubble. It's football, there is a chance neither of us will ...

... but do you really want to miss the chance to shout the Cattachs on to their relentless march back to the top of the table?
