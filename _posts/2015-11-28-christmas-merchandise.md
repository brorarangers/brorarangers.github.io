Worried about what to get the Brora Rangers fan in your life for Christmas? Worry no more! Santa's little elves have been busy making sure you can get your hands on some great Red & White gear for under the tree.

We've got a range of gifts to suit all occasions and all pockets. From Pin Badges and Key Rings to Hoodies and Training Tops, it's all available now.

We haven't got our online shop up and running yet, but you can have a good look at everything over on our [Merchandise](/merchandise/) page.

We've given the whole "Black Friday" shenanigans a body swerve, and replaced it with two "Super Saturday's" instead. We will have all the new merchandise on sale in the Social Club from midday until kickoff and then again until 7pm after the match on the 12th and 19th December.

What could be better than sorting out the Christmas shopping whilst backing the Reds in our two massive games against Cove Rangers and Fraserburgh? If you can't make it to the games, everything can also be ordered from [Mowat Print & Design, Main Street, Golspie](https://www.facebook.com/mowatprintanddesign/) or give Santa a phone on <a href="tel:01408633323">01408 633323</a>.

Happy Shopping!
