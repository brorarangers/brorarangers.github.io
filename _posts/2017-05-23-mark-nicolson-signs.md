Brora Rangers FC are delighted to announce the signing of experienced 28 year old defender Mark "Twiggy" Nicolson from Elgin City FC.

Currently being the longest serving player at the League 2 side, Nicholson moves to Brora after a 10 year stay at Borough Briggs. Having started his early career at Ross County, Mark joined Elgin on loan in 2007 before making the move permanent shortly after. He has operated in both defensive and midfield positions for Elgin and has worked with some fantastic players including our current centre back Jamie Duff.

Brora Rangers manager Ross Tokely was extremely pleased to get this signing wrapped up very quickly.

Tokely said, "having the ability to get Mark through the door so quickly was fantastic. It takes a little bit of pressure off us knowing that we have managed to bring in a real quality player so early on. We are looking at a range of players at the moment but Mark was one of the top players we wanted and I certainly believe he will play a vital part next season."

"One thing nobody can buy is experience and over 10 years at Elgin he has built up bags of experience and faced a lot of different styles of player which will really help us. He will also be able to be a wise head in the dressing room and guide the younger players that don't have the experience he has, so Mark coming in isn't just one dimensional it will work for us in a lot of different ways, and I'm sure he will get some real enjoyment out of being one of the most experienced in our dressing room."

On signing for Brora, Club Chairman William Powrie had the following to say;

"To capture Mark is a truly incredible achievement for the club. He is a proven and trusted player that has established his ability and leadership within the game and the players he has played with.He has put in some sensational performances over the past decade at Elgin."

"As the club helps Ross build for next season we importantly wanted to add players that give something more or different to what we already have and there is no doubt that Mark fits that bill. We also know he is familiar with a few of the players in our squad which we hope will help him fit in quickly. Although we were still in with a shout at the title on the last day this season we want to ensure that next season we don't leave it as late and bring the championship back to Dudgeon Park as quickly as we can and the addition of Mark will hopefully aid us in that."

Mark will join the club when they resume for pre-season training and it is thought he may make his Brora Rangers debut in Stornoway when Brora travel to play a Lewis and Harris select on 1st July.

A full interview with Mark will be published shortly.
