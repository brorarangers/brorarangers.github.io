It's the 2nd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup on Saturday 22nd October.

There is always something special about *'The Cup'*. A chance for the underdog to have his day, and in cases like this, a chance to measure your team against opposition from another League.

We've got League business to take care of at Pitmedden first, but we've already started to make plans for Clyde visiting on the 22nd.

Make the most of the occasion by booking hospitality for the afternoon.

A 3 course meal with a complimentary bar before the game, your stand match ticket along with a match programme and team sheet, half time refreshments and post match drinks, all in a relaxed and friendly environment. We have been receiving much praise for our hospitality package ... we think it is #unrivalled at Â£65.00 per person.

Interested? Drop us an [email](mailto: brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com) and we'll get it organised.
