Club physio Ashley Ross is delighted with the progress both Gavin Morrison and Paul Brindle are making, overcoming what at one stage looked like injuries which would sideline both for much of the early part of the season. 

Ashley was concerned that Gavin's closed season recovery to a knee injury had not been what it should have been, and immediately referred the player to a Consultant for cortisone injections and a knee scan. Ashley's timely intervention has seen Gavin make remarkable progress, so much so that he was able to train with the squad on Thursday evening. Gavin said " the referral to the Consultant was great-not only did it reassure me and the club there was no long term serious damage, but the cortisone certainly removed the pain. It's great to be back in training and I can now really look forward to the season."

Paul Brindle, who was carried off in the friendly against Ross County, was expected to be absent for 8 weeks. However he too has made a significant recovery and whilst he could not yet train fully, his injury is not as serious as first thought. 

A delighted Manager Grant Munro, welcomed the news from both players, and looked forward to being able to have them both available for selection in the not too distant future.
