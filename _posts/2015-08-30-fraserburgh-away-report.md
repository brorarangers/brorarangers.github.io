Brora Rangers resumed winning ways as they ran out very comfortable victors against a busy Fraserburgh outfit at Bellslea Park on a blustery Saturday. 

After last weeks defeat at the hands of Cove Rangers, player manager Richard Brittain rang the changes and  went with a different looking line up with Brindle, Graham and Brittain himself starting the match. After the game Brittain said his team were thoroughly deserving of the win and it was due reward for their hard work. 

For the second week in succession, the  small narrow pitch did not suit Brora's preferred style of wide play, but unlike against Cove, they adapted their game quickly to great effect.  Morrison and Gillespie quickly took control of midfield operations,with play making moves coming through the centre of the field where the speedy Brindle was a persistent thorn in the side of the Fraserburgh defence.

Having conceded early goals in their last two games, the Brora defence looked solid but suffered an unexpected blow when Grant Munro had to leave the field midway through the first half with a very nasty cut over his eye after a clash of heads. Martin Maclean came on with Gillespie dropping back to replace Munro who went off to Hospital. 

Despite having the vast majority of possession in the first half Brora squandered many scoring opportunities and peppered the Fraserburgh woodwork. Greg,Brindle, Graham and Sutherland will be disappointed they didn't get their name on the scoresheet as chances went begging. However with the break approaching Brora were awarded a penalty after a challenge on Brindle by Dickson and Richard Brittain slotted the ball home past the home keeper. 

Brora resumed after the interval  in determined fashion and immediately pushed Fraserburgh back onto the defence. Red waves of attacks followed and Paul Brindle scored the second goal after one such flowing move. Scott Graham nicely controlled a cross from Zander Sutherland and his accurate header found the boot of Paul Brindle who doubled Brora's advantage.

Brora were comfortably in command and with a bit of better finishing could have added another four or five, but a combination of great saves,the woodwork and some careless finishing kept the tally at just two. At the other end Fraserburgh created little bar a curling goal bound shot which produced an exceptional save from Malin high to his right.

Brora clearly learnt from last week, as they amended their preferred method of play to through the middle, with the normal wide men, Sutherland and Greig not seeing as much of the ball as in previous games this season. Gavin Morrison had an exceptional game, and was insightful with his distribution and considered with his challenges.

The last five minutes saw Fraserburgh mount a final push, having pulled back a goal, after the linesman judged the ball to have crossed Malin's line. It was a marginal decision and both Malin and Brittain received yellow cards for their vocal protestations. However the Brora defence were comfortably in control and the Cattachs returned north to Sutherland with all three points and looking forward to the home game with Inverness Clacnacuddin this Saturday.
