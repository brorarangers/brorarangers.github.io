Brora Rangers picked up against Fraserburgh where they left off against Cove Rangers the previous week, and took their game to a new level for the season, in a comprehensive thrashing 6-0 of a team who had only been beaten away from home once previously this season. 

Speaking after the match Fraserburgh boss, Mark Cowie commented " The Brora performance which we saw today was as good as any I've seen in the Highland League over many years, and Brora are easily the best team we have played this season" 

His Brora counterpart Richard Brittain was again delighted with the commitment and energy demonstrated by his side and felt that his side are playing with the confidence and composure that will be needed to retain the championship.

The outcome of the game may have been so different had four goal hero, Paul Brindle not got a very late promotion into the starting line up following a hamstring pull to Richard Brittain in the pre match warm up. 

The Dudgeon Park pitch, part frozen the previous Saturday, was pronounced playable after an inspection although it was especially heavy and saturated in places, but both teams were keen to fulfil the fixture and the referee took a very pragmatic view and was happy to proceed.

Brora ensured the tempo of the game started briskly and both wide men Greig and Sutherland were kept busy, as MacLean and Gillespie took control of the middle of the park and fed the Brora flankers. 

The Fraserburgh keeper was called into early action, saving well from John Macleod, and the Broch stopper was to see plenty of the ball as the afternoon progressed. 

The Cattachs took the lead after 16 minutes with a wonderfully taken header from Paul Brindle. Andrew Grieg picked up the ball wide on the left wing, beat Marc Dickson and picked out Brindle with a deep cross to the far post. Brindle has slipped the attentions of his marker Russell McBride and buried the ball into the net.

Brora were now in a set pattern of play, and had the Buchan side pinned back well inside their own half. Sutherland, Greig, Munro and Macleod all went close, before that man Brindle popped up to add his and Brora's second. 

A long kick out from Joe Malin, in 44 minutes found Sutherland who outpaced his marker, and his cut back to Brindle was so accurate, it allowed the striker to side step the defender and place the ball past the stranded Fraserburgh keeper. It was a great goal and a great time to score as it ensured Brora went into the half time break with a nice cushion. 

Brindle got his hat-trick 10 minutes after the restart to effectively end the game as a contest. Again a great cross from Sutherland, was picked up by Ally Macdonald who in turn found Brindle close in and he converted the chance well. 

There was no holding back the Brora speedster, who was practically unplayable by now and every time he got the ball he looked like scoring. Indeed it only took him another 3 minutes before he did, latching on well to a Martin Maclean through ball and drilling past  Barbour the Fraserburgh goalkeeper.

The directness of the route 1 football from Brora paid further dividends as it was Malin again that started the move which saw Zander Sutherland net number 5 with a 15 yard shot to which Barbour had no answer. 

Gillespie sent a free kick skyward over the Broch goal, but substitute Gavin Morrison can count himself unlucky as he saw his free kick crack against the post,again with the keeper beaten.

Brora's sixth and final goal came from Dale Gillespie, which drew down the curtain on a thoroughly outstanding afternoons performance .
Brora travel to Inverness Clachnacuddin on Boxing Day, whilst they will be hoping that Fraserburgh can do them a favour when they entertain Cove Rangers at Bellslea Park.
