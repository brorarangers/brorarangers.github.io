Saturday 26th November, originally scheduled for a trip to Forres, will now see Strathspey Thistle visit Dudgeon Park.

Forres Mechanics will be facing Stenhousemuir at Mosset Park, Buckie Thistle will be hosting Dunfermline Athletic, both Clubs attempting to fight their way into the 4th Round of the Scottish Cup.

That allows ourselves and the Strathy Jags to pick up where we left off at the beginning of the month.

Three home games in the same month. Three chances to sample our [Hospitality Package](/2016/08/12/hospitable-hospitality/).
