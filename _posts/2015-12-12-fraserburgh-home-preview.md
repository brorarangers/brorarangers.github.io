It's another home game for Brora this coming weekend as we host Fraserburgh FC. You all remember Fraserburgh FC. That's the team that have caused the biggest upsets at Dudgeon Park when no one else could.

|Pos|Team|Played|Won|Draw|Lost|Points|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Brora Rangers | 22 | 19 | 1 | 2 | 58 |
| 2 | Cove Rangers | 19 | 17 | 1 | 1 | 52 |
| 3 | Formartine Utd | 20 | 16 | 2 | 2 | 50 |
| .. | ........| .. | .. | .. | .. | .. |
| 8 | Fraserburgh | 21 | 10 | 4 | 7 | 34 |

A quick look at the League table as it stands after Week 20, and Brora's domination of Cove in their top of the table clash suggests there is little to fear here. It doesn't always work like that when Fraserburgh come to visit.
