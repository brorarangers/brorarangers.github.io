Whilst we've been missing out on games at Dudgeon Park, there has been plenty going off the pitch.

Alan Pollock has left us to join Forres Mechanics, whilst Scott Graham made the return trip to Dudgeon Park. Scott has signed up until June 2018 and made an immediate impact on his return, scoring twice against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Tuesday night in a training night match against Richie Foran's first team.

Scotty wasn't the only player to make his Brora return during the ICT game, as Lairg youngster, Will Counsell, signed from Alness FC, took his place in goals for the last 20 minutes of the match. The promising young keeper has signed up on a two and a half year deal.

Will was part of the Brora Rangers Youth squads before signing for Alness, and Chairman William Powrie is delighted with the aquisition as it further develops the strategy of developing youth players.

"Will has impressed everybody whilst training with us and Joe Malin feels he has real potential"

Will is delighted to be returning to Dudgeon Park, and commented, "It feels great to be back at Brora Rangers, where my career started as young boy.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to train, play and gain great experience with the club. I would like to thank the Chairman, Manager and players for giving me a chance and also making me feel welcome to the team.  I am very much looking forward to being part of the club and facing new and exciting challenges ahead."

We have also confirmed the signing of Kyle Macleod from Ross County. The 21 year old Black Isle striker has had experience at Elgin also. He has signed for Brora despite much interest from elsewhere, and Cattachs Manager Ross Tokely was delighted at the signing.

"Kyle is a proven striker, and powerful both on the park and in the air. I'm delighted that he has chosen Brora Rangers and I know he will be a great asset to the club" said Ross.
