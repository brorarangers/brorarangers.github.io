Our new Chairman, William Powrie, made the most of his first opportunity to pen a piece for our Programme earlier this week as further improvements were made to our Match Day experience. 

William and our Board are obviously committed to the development and progression of Brora Rangers and part of their goal is to further improve the communication between the Club and both the present and potential fan base.

Anyone who picked up the Match Programme on Wednesday evening will hopefully have seen yet more improvements in both the format and content of the publication ... and there is more to come.

When we first put this website together it was always acknowledged between those involved that it was very much a work in progress, yet over the course of last season, while we managed in the main to keep the Digital Dudgeon Park up to date with news articles, announcements of events and match previews and reports, it would be stretching facts to claim that it had 'developed'.

Fear not, though, as there has been work going on behind the scenes. We've cast a critical eye over the past year since the site was officially launched last August, listened to feedback and drawn up our plans. Our web developer keeps reminding us that a website has to change and adapt as our Club changes and progresses. Now is his chance create Brora Rangers FC Web 2.0. He doesn't have long - by the time you check back to read our preview of our home game against the Locos on the 10th September, you'll be reading it on our new look site.
