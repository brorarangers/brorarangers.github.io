Thanks to the convention of listing teams in alphabetical order in the shiny new league table at the start of every season, Brora Rangers usually have the honour of the top spot before the first kick of a ball. With our Petrofac Training Cup game against Alloa Athletic falling on the opening day of the Highland League campaign, we actually sat as low as 10th place until the following Wednesday evening's opening victory over Lossiemouth.

Goal difference saw us regain the top spot again the following Saturday. Our first League defeat since December 2013 saw us slip back to 3rd place as Cove Rangers well and truly threw down the gauntlet, and a further defeat to this Saturday's opposition pushed us another step down the ladder.

An unbeaten run since then, draws and losses for Formartine against the other early title challengers, and a Scottish Cup run for Cove Rangers, saw us regain the league leader position after a 4-0 victory over Buckie Thistle in mid November. And there we have stayed. Brora have resolutely held on to the top spot since our 19th game of the season.

Since reclaiming the top spot it's been the roller coaster ride that brings out the best in all competitions; a 2-0 victory at home over Cove, a fantastic 6-0 victoy over Fraserburgh, the incredible 1-10 Boxing Day display at Grant Street Park ... a shock defeat to an organised Nairn County, a succession of postponed games due to frozen and waterlogged pitches and last week's nail-biting 1-1 draw against the Locos.

And it all leads us to this ...

 |  | P | W | D | L | GD | Pts |
 |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 | Brora | 29 | 24 | 2 | 3 | 88 | 74 |
 | Cove | 28 | 24 | 1 | 3 | 54 | 73 |
 | Formartine | 28 | 23 | 3 | 2 | 84 | 72 |
 
We are still sitting in the number 1 position, we have 5 games left to play, the contenders have 6. On Saturday we meet Formartine Utd on their home turf. Barring some incredible twists of fate in the remaining 4 or 5 games, the winner of this match keeps their title hopes alive, the losers are all but out of the running.
 
No one who made it along to Pitmedden for our [League Cup Quarter Final](/2016/03/07/formartine-away-report.html) match at the start of the month will be in any doubt about the potential this next meeting has to be a 'must see' game. Those who missed the Cup thriller get a second bite at the cherry to see two incredibly closely matched teams fight for glory again.
 
For the management, coaching and playing staff at Brora Rangers it has to be a 'one game at a time' attitude and they can only influence the matches they are part of. For the rest of us, it would be naive to think we won't have an eye on the other games being played out as the 2015/16 League campaign comes ever closer to the final game for the challengers on the 16th April. Those incredible twists of fate mentioned earlier can, and do, happen.

This lady may well be warming up the vocal chords in preparation for the 2015/16 Highland League Champions, but it's still far from decided who she's going to sing for.

Richie Brittain usually closes out his spot in our match programmes every week with the same call to action.

*"I ask that each and everyone of you get right behind the lads again and help drive us on to victory."*

If we had to edit our preview down to today's media age soundbite, we could do worse than leave out all the league position history, big win reminiscing and large boned ladies references and distill it down to that one message.
