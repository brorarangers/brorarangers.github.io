This Saturday's home game against Deveronvale has more than just the outcome of the match at stake. It is time to cast your votes.

Voting slips will be available for both our Player of the Year Awards and to nominate the next two Hall of Fame entrants.

Last season Zander picked up the Supporters Player of the Year, with John Pickles awarded Young Player of the Year.

John Suttar joined our Hall of Fame, along with Club stalwarts Gavin MacLeod and Sheena Manson.

Who is it going to be this season? Well, that's mostly up to you.

For those that can't make the game, but are in the Brora Rangers Supporters Club Facebook page, you can vote for your [Player of the Year here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/225232144272600/permalink/1482747875187681/) and your [Hall of Fame nominees here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/225232144272600/permalink/1480064008789401/)

Whilst our final home game will now be against Turriff Utd on the 5th May, our official end of season celebrations and awards will be after our match against Cove Rangers on the 14th April.

So there is no time to lose ... get voting!
