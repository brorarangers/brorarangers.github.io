Our Irn Bru Cup tie against Raith Rovers is to take place on Tuesday 15th August, with a 19:45 kick off. It could be a trip well worth making.

Almost a year to the day since we very nearly upset [Peterhead in the 2nd Round](/2016/08/16/peterhead-away-report/) of the same competition, we have already shown that victory against League 1 opposition is far from outwith our grasp when it comes to cup fixtures.

With a 400 mile round trip from Dudgeon Park to Starks Park, it's a big ask for the Brora based support to make a mid week jaunt to the Lang Toun, but for those that travelled to Peterhead last season, the journey time will be surprisingly similar.

Raith Rovers are making their League intentions clear on Twitter just now with the [#RoaringBack](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RoaringBack&src=typd) hashtag, but Sutherland's Cattach may just be the beast to silence the Rover's lion ... if only for one game.
