Brora Rangers bagged a further three points at the expense of Inverness Clachnacuddin when they won 3-0 at a cold blustery Dudgeon Park yesterday.

The game was not a classic, as Clach came to defend and in the main the match was played within their own half. The Clach keeper had a busy day and kept Brora at bay, until Dale Gillespie broke the deadlock a few minutes before half time.

Substitute Steven Mackay doubled the advantage before an own goal later in the day put the result beyond doubt.
