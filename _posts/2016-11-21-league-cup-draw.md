It is no secret that we like good omens in football, indeed the beautiful game attracts its fair share of lucky rituals and superstitions.

So a home tie against Inverurie Loco Works in the 1st Round of the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup suits us just fine. The League Cup draw made at Harlaw Park this afternoon sees Strathspey Thistle host Formartine Utd and Keith host Forres in the prelimanary Round before the First Round takes place on the 11th February.

The First Round ties all look like good value for money for supporters of the Highland League:

- Brora Rangers v Inverurie Loco Works
- Deveronvale v Nairn County
- Wick Academy v Turriff Utd
- Clachnacuddin v Fort William
- Huntly v Fraserburgh
- Cove Rangers v Lossiemouth
- Rothes v Strathspey Thistle / Formartine Utd
- Buckie v Keith / Forres Mechanics

We won this fixture 4-1 last season, followed by the nailbiting matches against Formartine Utd, Cove Rangers and Nairn County to lift this trophy.
