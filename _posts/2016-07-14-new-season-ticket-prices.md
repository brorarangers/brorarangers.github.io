It's only a couple of weeks before our 2016-17 season gets going for real, with a trip to Nairn's Station Park. That means it's time to get a hold of your Season Tickets, and we have some exciting new changes to announce.

Admission for our League games remains unchanged at **£9.00** for adults with **£5.00 Concessions**. Admission to the stand is also unchanged at **£1.00**. We'll have details of our new *Junior Cattach's* scheme soon, but as an indication of our plans, under 12s are now entitled to free entry on match days.

An Adult Stand Season Ticket also remains at **£140.00**, with the Concession Stand Ticket at **£80.00**. Similarly the Adult Ground Season Ticket is **£125.00** with a **£65.00 Concession**

Our Gold Ticket has been increased to **£475.00**, which we feel reflects the true value of the package, and we have introduced a new *Boardroom Hospitality Package* which includes entry to the game, pre and post match drinks in the Boardroom along with quality half-time fayre, a Match Day Programme and acknowledgement, all for the fantastic price of **£30.00** per game.

Finally, we have an exciting new package with a host of great value benefits, the *Vice President's Club*. The full details will follow, but at **£750.00** for the season we can assure you it is an investment worth investigating.
