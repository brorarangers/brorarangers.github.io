Whilst Tokes and the lads will now be firmly focused on training and tactics for our Cup tie against the Civil Service Strollers, there is some unfinished business from Round 1 to attend to.

Head on over to [The Scottish Cup Goal of the Round](http://scottishfa.co.uk/football_poll.cfm?page=4173) page for four delightful goals from the 1st Round, featuring no less than 3 Highland League clubs.

Jordan Macrae from Nairn County, Daniel Moore from Rothes and Samuel Nhamburo from Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale all deserve a wee watch before voting for our very own Andrew Greig.

Watch out Civil Service Strollers ... Chubbs is coming to get you.
