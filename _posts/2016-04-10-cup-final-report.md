Brora Rangers won the Highland League Cup for the first time in their history after defeating Nairn County in a penalty shoot out, after a 0-0 scoreline following extra time, at Grant Street Park Inverness. 

It will not go down as a classic final, and in the main the midfield playmakers on both sides cancelled themselves out, with long periods of stalemate. 

Brora Rangers probably shaded the first half, and Nairn County the second, with only one clear cut chance falling to each side. Joe Malin in the Brora goal did have a couple of stretching saves to make, but that was the extent of the match highlights. 

The penalty shoot outs are always a bit of a lottery and once again it was the Cattachs that came out on top when Zander Sutherland slotted home Brora's fifth to secure that elusive cup win. 

It was a fitting win for Brora Manager Richard Brittain and his preparation for discussing match scenarios including penalties, beforehand with his players, again paid dividends and ultimately delivered that sought after piece of silverware.
