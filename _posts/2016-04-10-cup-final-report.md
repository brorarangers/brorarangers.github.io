Brora won the Highland League Cup in what was frankly a disappointing match that was a lot closer than many had predicted. After a goal-less 120 minutes, the Cattachs prevailed 5-4 on penalties, the third consecutive round in which they have won by a sudden death shoot out. 

Having surprisingly beaten the Cattachs at Dudgeon Park at the beginning of the year, Nairn once more reverted to the same system and changed things round to combat Brora’s style of play and to hit them more on the break. It very nearly succeeded again. 

It was a game of two halves. If this was a boxing match, Brora would have been ahead on points at the break without really hurting Nain given that they had the bulk of the pressure albeit without showing much of the cutting edge that has made them the Highland League’s top scorers again this season.

In the second period of normal time, the Wee County came much more into it and were really dangerous on the break. It brought out the best from Joe Malin, returning for his first match in six weeks since injuring his right knee in the quarter final at Formartine. Although he was unable to kick with his right foot, he showed his class with several top drawer saves, especially in the last 15 minutes of normal time. 

Brora had the first clear chance in the 13th minute when Nairn keeper Calum Antell made a hash of a clearance out from goal. The ball went no more than 30 yards and straight to Zander Sutherland who instantly returned the ball goalwards. Antell recovered his ground quickly, however, and was back on his line to hold Sutherland’s effort. 

Three minutes later, one of Nairn’s breaks almost caught Brora out when Sam Urquhart’s left wing cross picked out Alan Pollock near the penalty spot but with just Malin to beat, he shot wide at the near post. 

On 35 minutes, Steven MacKay met a left wing cross from Zander Sutherland with a ferocious volley from 10 yards that was blocked on the line by Adam Naismith. MacKay vehemently claimed that a hand was used in blocking his volley but the referee didn’t agree. 

Just before half time Dale Gillespie’s long range piledriver was acrobatically tipped over the bar by Calum Antell and in first half added time a slick Brora move saw Zander Sutherland’s through ball find Scott Graham one on one with Antell but he was flagged offside. It was at best marginal so we were goal-less at the break.

The second half started in the same pattern as the first with Brora dominating possession and Nairn looking to hit them on the break. On the hour mark Brora brought on Paul Brindle for Scott Graham in an attempt to force the breakthrough.

The main architect of Nairn’s New Year smash and grab win at Brora was Robbie Duncanson but he was unusually quiet in this game and it was no surprise when on 75 minutes Nairn replaced him with big striker Tony Wallace. This showed their growing confidence in their attack’s ability to hurt Brora.

3 minutes after the change, Wallace played in Alan Pollock on the edge of the 6 yard box and this time Pollock drove across the face of the goal and a whisker wide of the far post.

This was followed in the 80th and 81st minutes by 2 exceptional saves from Joe Malin from consecutive 20 yard drives. The first was good and the second was even better to claw away Gregg Main’s goal bound effort for a corner.

The game was played in a good spirit and it took until added time for the first booking of the afternoon with Dale Gillespie getting a yellow card for body checking in midfield. After this, the cards came thick and fast!   Alan Pollock found his way into the referee’s notebook for dissent and two minutes into extra time Paul Brindle was booked for charging down Antell’s clearance which was puzzling given that the ball was outside the box when it dropped from the keeper’s hands and Brindle had every right to challenge for it. Then it was Gregg Main’s turn to see yellow for holding back Andrew Greig.

Brora should have been ahead 5 minutes into extra time. Paul Brindle beat Nairn keeper Calum Antell to a long through ball, rounded him and then shot into the side netting with the open goal at his mercy. 

The second period of extra time produced no clear chances and was characterised by Sam Urquhart being replaced by the dangerous Conor Gethins, who wasn’t match fit but was clearly brought on with penalties in mind. In the very final minute, Brora’s Martin MacLean was dismissed for an uncharacteristic 2 footed challenge on Glenn Main that resulted in a straight red card.

In the penalty shoot-out each side converted the first 4 spot kicks without either keeper getting a sniff. Nairn went first and their marksmen were Gethins, Tony Wallace, Gregg Main and Alan Pollock with Andrew Greig, Grant Munro, Paul Brindle and Colin Williamson replying for Brora. 

The fifth penalties proved to be decisive. Nairn’s club captain, Michael Morrison, who only came on a couple of minutes before the end of the first period of extra time, stepped up for Nairn and Joe Malin got down to save his spot kick.

This left Zander Sutherland with the task of converting his penalty to take the trophy to Brora. Despite the pressure, he coolly sent Calum Antell the wrong way to seal the win and cue delirium in the red ranks.
