It's the penultimate League game of the season for Brora Rangers on Wednesday evening. We head into this game still clinging to our top of the table status. 

If the 3 points are secured, we'll leave Forres with our Number 1 position intact. Then it is somewhat out of our hands.
 
For ourselves and the Can Cans it's the 'Big Game'. For our League Cup opponents and 9th place Fraserburgh the 'Big Game' is at Station Park. For the title contenders and presumably every other Highland League fan, all eyes will be on the match at Harlaw Park.

|  | P | W | D | L | GD | Pts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brora | 32 | 25 | 4 | 3 | 89 | 79 |
| Cove | 30 | 26 | 1 | 3 | 62 | 79 |
| Formartine | 30 | 24 | 4 | 2 | 88 | 76 |
 
Forres come into this game on the back of a defeat to Clachnacuddin, whilst we have to pick ourselves up from the draw against Wick Academy. Anyone who sees this as a *'nothing game'* is sadly mistaken. Forres currently sit in 11th place with 41 points and 6 games left to play. They finished last season in 9th place on 57 points. With home games against Strathspey, Nairn and Buckie and trips to Huntly and Deveronvale to come they can fight their way back to a top half position again. Whilst we are relying on favourable results from Clachnacuddin, Nairn County, Strathspey Thistle and Turriff Utd over the next week and a half if we are to fly the 2015/16 League Flag over Dudgeon Park, there is more than a League Championship to play for on Wednesday night.
 
We last met Forres back in October, they came to Dudgeon Park with 5 straight league wins behind them. We certainly brought their successful run to a shuddering halt with a 6-0 skelping. Goals from Graham, Gillespie, Zander Sutherland and a Brindle hat-trick were the outcome of a purposeful team display that Saturday. A purposeful team display is exactly what we need again.
 
This game isn't just about grabbing 3 points. This game isn't just about keeping the spluttering flame of a 3rd Championship alive. This game is more than a final push to grab a bye into the 2nd round of next season's Scottish Cup.
 
This game is about confidence, determination and belief. 
 
Confidence from the squad after two disappointing finishes to our more recent matches, confidence from the fantastic travelling support this season to continue backing Brora Rangers to the final whistle.
 
Determination from a squad who have fought valiantly throughout the season and most especially in our League Cup quarter and semi finals, determination from all involved with our Club to stand shoulder to shoulder as the season draws to an end.
 
Belief from a squad who are only days away from the opportunity to rewrite Highland League and Brora Rangers history yet again in a League Cup Final, belief from those who bring the defiant splash of red to terraces around the league that this is a team who won't lie down.
 
If that all sounds a bit like a sabre rattling war cry, good. This isn't a *nothing game*.
