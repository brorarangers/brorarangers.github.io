Brora Rangers headed back north with a comfortable but unspectacular win against a Turriff side who were set up to have an emphasis on defence. The 1-0 win for the Cattachs moved them up to 4th in the table and sets up an intriguing clash with unbeaten Lossiemouth at Dudgeon Park on Wednesday evening.   

Brora started with trialist Ross Tokely at centre half, with Sutherland, Campbell and Brindle up front, and indeed Brindle could have scored very early on, but his shot went high and wide. 

Malin was called to make his first and only save of the match after 20 minutes when the Brora defence were caught square, but Malin moved very quickly to close down the danger. 

The first half was goalless, but Brora started the second half brightly, and quickly asserted their dominance. Craig Campbell broke the deadlock in 55 minutes slotting in from close range after some good wide work from Brindle. 

Zander Sutherland and Paul Brindle both brought great saves from the Turriff keeper, but no further goals were added and the 3 points were safely secured.
