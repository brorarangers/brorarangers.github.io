The Brora Rangers Golf Day continues to be a great event, helped along again this year by the fantastic weather.

This year's overall winners were Richard Mackenzie Ltd with their team of Munro Ferries, Alan Mackenzie, Craig Moffatt and Richard Mackenzie himself. Some red hot putting saw them turn in a nett score of 56.3.

Richard and his team are fantastic supporters of Brora Rangers, and it was a great pleasure to present them with their prizes at the conclusion of the day.

Coming in a creditable 2nd place were 'The Young Team'. It doesn't seem like that long ago since these lads were the backbone of our junior support, making more noise in the Red Shed than their collective height would suggest.

In 3rd place were the gents from City Financial.

Thanks again to all who came along to support us and spend time enjoying the fantastic course and hospitality that the staff at Brora Golf Club expertly provide.

Lastly, a special mention for John Docherty for being 'Nearest the Pin' on the day.

Events like our Golf Day, our dinners in the Kingsmills in Inverness and our Hall of Fame evening in Brora are vital fund raisers for the Football Club. Once again we'd like to express our appreciation to all those who support us.
