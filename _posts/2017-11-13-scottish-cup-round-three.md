Saturday sees the Third Round of the Scottish Cup take place around the country. 16 Clubs will be competing from Aberdeen to Stranraer in a bid to progress into the next round.

Before we go further, as you read this article, you can ponder which footballer has played for both Stranraer and Brora Rangers in his career ..

Whilst Brechin City head to Buckie and Forfar Athletic head to Pitmedden, Fraserburgh, Cove and ourselves are on the road. But as far as we are concerned, it's all about the Brora.

William Hill and the SFA possibly agree - or, at least they agree it's all about Stranraer vs Brora Rangers in terms of their Match of the Round.

Stranraer have already got their ['Keep it aff the deck' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bATvqt7_xN0) up on YouTube ... Joe Malin wouldn't have let his mates down like that ...

We await the upload of the footage from our training session, but let's be honest, it's all a bit of fun. Saturday is where it really matters.

Actually, what really matters is what we take away from this game. Did Saturday's performance against Lossiemouth show us the ideal starting 11 for Brora? Can we go one better than our recent perfomances against higher league teams? Can we build on performances against Peterhead and Raith Rovers in Cup competitions?

 Whilst the decisions made by Ross before the game, and the attitude and performance of the lads during the game will have a decisive impact on the outcome of these questions, there is a further factor to consider ... the 12th man.

 Thanks to the SFA and William Hill, the Supporters bus making it's 14 hour return trip to An t-Sr√≤n Reamhar will be free. Thanks to Colin McBeath the whole shebang is going to be organised and you can get a seat.

 Are you still thinking about the former Stranraer FC and Brora Rangers player? He won't be on the bus, but he'll be in Stranraer in his role as founder of the Brora Rangers Supporters Club (Dumbarton Branch)

 We're on a Cup run just now. The North of Scotland Cup is back in the cabinet, and we're back in the hunt for a 4th Round draw again for the William Hill Scottish Cup. Like the past glories that our mystery player took us to back in 1979-80, this could be a huge part of Brora Rangers history in the making. It's a longer trek than our 4th Round tie against Queen of the South a few seasons ago, but ask anyone who made the effort to attend that game and ask if they regret it.

 We know several diehards have organised a weekend away to ensure they are there to back the lads and be part of our history, but if you aren't one of them, give [Colin a shout on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cmacbeath1) or email us [here](mailto: brorarangers@gmail.com) to book a seat on the free bus, a fantastic day out and a chance to be the 12th man that made the difference on the 18th November 2017.

 And our mystery player?

 Original 'Hall of Fame' inductee, Bobby Duffy plied his trade down in Wigtonshire in the early seventies. That was only just before he arrived up here to get the hang of lifting trophies.

 Stranraer have kindly invited *'The Gaffer'* to this match, so he'll need to watch his manners ... but we all know.
