After a week of publicising ourselves on here and across our Social Media platforms to make the most of our Scottish Cup game, it's time for something a bit different.

The website team put in a huge amount of effort to produce articles to keep everyone up to date with all the Dudgeon Park news, and seeing the amount of visitors who read these articles is hugely satisfying. But today, we want you to stop reading this article for a moment.

That's right. Stop reading. Scroll right down to the foot of the page and have a look at our new Website Sponsors.

{% include article-image.html image="1" float="right" %}

We'll just wait up here for you to come back once you've seen it.

So this article is really a big public thank you to **Brora Golf Club**, the **Sutherland Arms Garage**, **The Royal Marine Hotel**, the **Trawler Restaurant** and **Highland Waste Services**.

Whilst the Scottish football press has barely stopped talking about the recent visit of Paris Saint Germain and their backers, Oryx Qatar Sports Investments, we think the businesses below offer far more than the Dohar investment team ... local support for a local Club.

They are not alone in their support for Brora Rangers FC, but today, they are our website heroes. Expect to see far more of them in our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) and [Facebook posts](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/)

Thanks again, folks, here's to bringing you some real Northern Exposure this season.
