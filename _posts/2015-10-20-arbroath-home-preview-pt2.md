In Brora vs Arbroath ... [Part 1](/2015/10/19/arbroath-home-preview-pt1.html) we had a quick look at an Arbroath squad who are stringing together some impressive wins, showing both East Fife and Montrose that their current position in the League Two table counts for nothing.

We know from experience that the outcome of any game, especially in the Scottish Cup, can be swayed by the 12th man. Arbroath fans seem to fully understand that phenomenon.

It would appear that the Brora Red Army who made such an impact last season aren't the only ones to make the most of a big day out. The Red Lichties faithful made a great effort last month to help their team start a winning run at Bayview in Fife ... they are no strangers to the [Sombrero and Poncho look](http://www.arbroath-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/best_fans_around_870712/index.shtml) favoured by a few of our own during our recent Cup successes.

It's great to see a Club acknowledging their Supporters, and especially encouraging to see young supporters putting effort into backing their home team. It's all shaping up to be a great afternoon on the 24th, and we look forward to welcoming the Arbroath support to the village and to Dudgeon Park. There are two buses heading up to practically reverse our own journey in last season's Play Off against Montrose, and a quick glance at [Pie & Bovril](http://www.pieandbovril.com/forum/index.php/topic/226404-brora-vs-arbroath/) confirms that a sizeable contingent plan letting the train take the strain. 

Let's keep an eye out for Lichtgilphead ...

... those Cattachs who made a similar weekend of it in Dumfries last season can testify to the extra sparkle brought to that Cup tie by the hospitality of the Doonhamers.

However, Abroath beware. There is a real case of 'Anything you can do, we can do better' when it comes to supporters. 

Our sombreros are bigger ...

It's always a risky business looking at a weather forecast too far ahead, but October has been Defying the Odds so far this year and refusing to yield to the worst the autumn can throw at the hardy football supporter. At the minute, however, various online sources all seem to agree that early rain will clear up by kick off to give us a dry, bright if breezy afternoon.
