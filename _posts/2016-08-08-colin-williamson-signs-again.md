Brora Rangers are delighted that negotiations to secure the services of Colin Williamson have been successfully concluded and he has extended his contract until 2020.

Colin said "I'm delighted that the club wanted me to stay with them,and I certainly did. The club has great ambition and I want to play my part in securing their success. We have a great squad for this season and not too many teams will relish us rocking up on a Saturday afternoon".

Speaking on behalf of the Board, Ben Mackay said "That's all bar one of the players on extended contracts now, and we intend to sort that out very soon. We're delighted Colin has extended his terms and I'm sure he will continue to be a great presence at the heart of our defence."
