Almost exactly one hundred and twenty years ago, April 6th 1896 to be exact, a Scot became famous for being the first British Olympic athlete to win a gold medal for lifting something - one handed. Moments earlier he had become Britain's first silver medal winner for lifting something - two handed. [Launceston Elliot](http://www.olympic.org/news/launceston-elliot-gbr-weightlifting/242762), have a read, it's quite a story.

We've had a few famous 'lifting' events in our own history. Steven Mackay has practised his two handed lifting technique at Grant Street Park. We all know 'Sid' is a man who believes in proper preparation, he's even gone so far as to practice his lifting technique at Grant Street, whilst allowing this weekend's fellow finalists to pick up the runners up medals. 

But the League Cup has always been snatched and grabbed by someone else. When Saturday comes the lads in red will be hoping to add to their medal haul. When Saturday comes we hope to be doing some more historic lifting of our own. When Saturday comes we want to lift the Highland League Cup.

We are confident in our lifting capabilities, we've a few backroom staff who have been happy to share their techniques.

We have a good few players who know how to win a Cup Final against Nairn County at Grant Street Park.

However, let's not get too carried away. Nairn County haven't been disregarding their own lifting practice. They too have lifted the League Championship trophy, back in 1975/76. They too have lifted the North of Scotland Cup, seven times. They too have lifted the Inverness Cup. They've practised hard, they've paid attention to details, they've lifted the Highland League Cup, twice, just to make sure. To be fair, when it comes to the lifting part, they've possibly got the edge. Just.

There's a craft to writing website articles. Reading online, on a computer screen, on a mobile phone, it's different from reading from a piece of paper. It's harder to keep the reader on board. Harder to keep the reader immersed and willing to read every paragraph, every line, every word. If you want to drop out here, skip a bit, skim over some text and look for the real meat of our preview, that's fine. This is a great place to do it - we'll catch up with you further down the page. Because we can't really avoid looking at our last few meetings with The Wee County, and it makes sense to do it in chronological order.

[Focused Nairn up to Muster](/2016/01/02/nairn-home-report.html) was our headline after our last meeting. We came into the game on the back of a glorious 1-10 victory at Grant Street Park, Nairn hoping to recover from a 1-4 home defeat by Keith. It's all there in the report, Nairn didn't give up, Nairn took their chances, Nairn left Dudgeon Park with 3 points. It was a result that shook Dudgeon Park.

Earlier in the season [The Magnificent 7](/2015/09/09/nairn-away-report.html) was a far happier occasion for the Cattachs.  A single goal from Steven Mackay in the first half was all that could separate us. The away dressing room half time team talk must have been worth listening to. Paul Brindle certainly took something from it, as he went on to hand out a swift hat-trick. Richie, Zander and Dale finding the net completing the Magnificent 7, and our Match Reporter for the night stating: **"As comprehensive and decisive as I've seen us this season. An utter joy to watch."**

Our head to head record against Nairn County over the past few seasons is pretty happy reading for us, in the world of 'games played and games won' we have got the edge. More than 'just'. Our recent Cup history against Nairn is equally pleasing.

Nairn aren't coming into this game on a particulary strong run of results, but given that they've lost to Turriff and Cove, and drawn with Wick, Huntly and Fraserburgh we would do well not to dwell on that too much.

Wednesday night saw a dominant Brora side dismantle Forres 0-3 at Mosset Park. There were no signs of nerves, no signs of uncertainty and every sign that all involved wanted to ensure their inclusion on Saturday's team sheet. Indeed, if Richie Brittain has a headache ahead of the Cup Final, it's who on earth is going to start this game on the bench.

So, for those of a nervous disposition who scrolled forward from our sixth paragraph, it's the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup Final on Saturday 9th April. Grant Street Park, Inverness, Brora Rangers against Nairn County, kick-off at 3pm. Recent results probably count for little, past glories count for nothing. Saturday's result means everything. Launceston Elliot was the first man to win an Olympic Medal for the one handed lift. This Brora Rangers squad can become the first to lift the Highland League Cup. We don't care how many hands they use.

That's been a lot of lifting. However, if there is one thing we have unswerving confidence in, it's the Red Army's dedication to lifting.

This Saturday, **you** can be the voices that lifted the team that lifted the Cup.
