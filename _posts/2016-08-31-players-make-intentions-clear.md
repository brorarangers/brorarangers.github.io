On the back of a magnificent 7-0 demolition of a previously high flying Lossiemouth side, Brora Rangers have more good news for Cattachs fans.

Martin Maclean has signed a contract extension until 2020, and Ross Tokely has signed a one year contract.

Le√≤dhasach Martin was originally signed from Back FC in 2012 and has made himself an integral part of the Brora Rangers midfield over recent seasons.

Not too long after we signed Martin, Ross arrived at Dudgeon Park and quickly became a fans' favourite. His absence at the end of 2014 due to work overseas left some of our young defenders with big boots to fill. With 17 years of top flight football experience behind him, and his knowledge of the Highland League from his previous spell at the Club, we're delighted to have him back on the books, and the pitch, once again.
