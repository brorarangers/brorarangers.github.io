Brora Rangers are delighted to announce that Kyle MacLeod has penned a 2 year deal at Dudgeon Park.

MacLeod, who joined Brora after being released by Ross County has made a great impact at the club since his arrival and the club especially wanted to retain his services.

Seeing through his developmental years at Ross County, Kyle was a well trained and educated striker that was always going to bring a different dynamic to the club. Prior to his release from the Scottish Premier League he spent a short time on loan at Borough Briggs with Elgin City, however mid way through this season joined Brora. His performances have been strong and the young striker has gained much acclaim for his work during his spell in the Highland League with an astounding goal rate on top of his incredible talent.

Team Manager Ross Tokely commented "Having Players such as Kyle now signed to the club means that we see that he is a talent worth fostering and developing. We have every faith in his ability to deliver going forward, although he has shown a great amount of commitment and goals in his time with us already.

He is also a younger player and this is the angle want to go down in trying to build teams for the longer term and bring in experience where needed to ensure the younger players have that important guidance.

 It's also important to note that Kyle has extensive experience having come through a very high-class and professional system at Ross County: you only have to look at their development team this season to see they have really developed quality talent and luckily enough we have benefitted with Kyle.

We firmly believe Kyle is really settled here and that next season he will be a huge player for us that will provide upwards of 30 goals per season."
