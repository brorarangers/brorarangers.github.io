Saturday 18th November 2017. That's a date that is going to resonate with Brora Rangers for a long, long time.

There seemed to be a belief amongst both the squad and the fans that Brora 'might just get something from this', and get something we did. A place in the 4th Round of the William Hill Scottish trip after beating Stranraer by a single goal at Stair Park.

And what a goal it was.

That brings our 2017-18 Scottish Cup campaign tally to:

 - Goals for: 11
 - Goals against: 0

A pretty impressive record, and one to give us all the confidence we need as we head towards our 4th Round tie against another League 1 Club, East Fife, on the 20th January 2018.
