Few would deny that this is the game of the weekend in the Highland Football League.

We need to go back to October 2013 to find the last time Brora beat Cove away from home, a second round Scottish Cup replay. Last season saw two low scoring draws in the League, and Cove were the team who seemed best equipped to contain the Cattachs. Indeed it was Cove who knocked us out of the League Cup last season after a penalty shoot out.

This time round both teams are making no secret of their desire to finish top come next April, and with both teams unbeaten in the League so far, something has to give.

Brora may take some heart from a quick comparison of our opening games of the season against both Keith and Buckie where our scorelines have been slightly more impressive ... slightly.

The Supporters Club are running a bus to Harlaw Park in Inverurie leaving Dudgeon Park at 10:00am ... get in touch if you want a seat to see what promises to be a thrilling game from two high scoring sides.
