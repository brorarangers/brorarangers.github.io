We were originally scheduled to make the trip to Mosset Park last November, but their victory over Cumbernauld Colts saw them host Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Cup instead.

Along with three other meetings, this game has now been rearranged to take place on Wednesday 15th February, with an 8pm kick off. Clachnacuddin will play Formartine Utd at Grant Street Park, Cove Rangers travel to face Huntly, and Wick Academy make the journey to Lossiemouth to complete the Wednesday night fixture list.
