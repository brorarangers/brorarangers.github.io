Brora Rangers ambitions to lift a third Press and Journal League title were dealt a near fatal blow at local derby rivals Wick, when the Caithness men netted twice in the last 15 minutes to level the match at 2-2 and deprive Brora of the win they needed to keep the league challenge alive. 

For the second game in succession Brora lost concentration and shape in the last quarter hour of the match, and on Saturday this cost them the win they so dearly needed and very much deserved. However "with many a slip between and lip", 10 man Wick managed to capitalise on the Brora slackness and salvage a point. 

The day in the far north was pleasantly spring like, and the good weather had brought out a crowd well north of 1000, including another healthy contingent of travelling Cattach supporters. 

Stephen Mackay started up front for Brora with Paul Brindle who was carrying an injury confined to the  the bench. Brora were facing up the notorious Harmsworth Park  slope in the first half, and started in a manner befitting of champions anxious to maintain their crown. 

From the off Brora had the Wick defence under great pressure and both Sutherland and Greig went close. However there was only 6 minutes on the clock when Dale Gillespie was in the right place to fire home after a scramble in the Wick box, which the home side were unable to clear. 

As the half  progressed the Reds became even more dominant and both Brown and Maclean forced good saves from Sean McCarthy the busy Wick keeper. Greig and Maclean narrowly missed with well taken drives, before Dale Gillespie added his and Brora's second with just a few minutes to run until the break. 

The game was quite physical with Wick attracting 4 yellow cards before half time, as they struggled to get to grips with a fluent and composed Brora side. 

Brora started the second period in a composed and attacking style, and with the slope and wind at their backs, were looking to quickly add to their tally. Possibly  due to the slope and the ball running away from them, the Brora front line found it difficult to control and hold the ball, and the Cattachs best chances were restricted to long range efforts from Munro, Gillespie and Maclean. 

In keeping with the physicality of the first half, no quarter was being given, and it was of no surprise whatsoever when Allen received his marching orders from the referee for raising a hand to Martin Maclean. 

Down to 10 men, the Wick side were up against it, and to Manager Connelly's credit he put on Marc MacGregor for Gary Weir and this transformed the fortunes of the Caithness side. 

Brora irrationally resorted to far too many long punts down the hill which were easily dealt with by the Wick defenders and allowed the Caithness outfit to build their moves from the back, through the middle of the park, and despite playing with only 10 men, seemed to be a yard quicker to the ball than Brora. 

One such move lead to Wick pulling a goal back when Macgregor weaved his way through a pedestrian Brora back line and delivered a pin point cross from the left, onto the head of the unmarked Richard Macadie, who gave Martin no chance from close range. 

As much as a shock as the Wick goal was, there was much much worse to come as they surged forward and with 7 minutes remaining MacGregor equalised from close range following some skilful work from Sam Mackay in the middle of the park. 

From 2 goals up and in control, Brora found themselves amazingly hanging on for a point, although Steven Mackay very nearly rescued the win for them, but only just failed to get onto the end of a long ball from Brindle. 

There were ecstatic scenes from the home side at the final whistle and the Brora travelling support were left to contemplate the potential loss of the league title, barring a total collapse from rivals Cove Rangers and Formartine.
