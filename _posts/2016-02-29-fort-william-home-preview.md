This Wednesday has a feel of the Number 2 about it. It's the 2nd day of March; it will be our 2nd attempt to get our home game against Fort William underway; it is our 2nd home League game of 2016.

You read that correctly, we've made it into March before playing our 2nd home League game of 2016. We've bounced back from the shock defeat at the hands and feet of an organised Nairn County at the start of the year through a commanding display over Turriff later in the month. We've ensured our place in the Quarter Finals of the Highland League Cup with a home win over Inverurie Locos at the start of February. And here we are starting March with our 4th game of the season.

Fort William have managed to see some action over the past 2 weekends, though both have seen them the losers in 6 - 1 scorelines. We are assuming they will be keen not to make it three in a row.

For all those who have been hanging on since our last match for their highland football fix (603 hours by kick off, for those who are counting), you know where to meet on Wednesday evening. It's an 8pm kick off, and the squad are just as impatient as everyone else to get back to League action and consolidate our position at the top of the table.
