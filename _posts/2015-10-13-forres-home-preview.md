A 2-0 win over Keith last Saturday saw Forres chalk up 5 league wins on the trot. Add that to their comfortable victory over Lossiemouth in the first round of the Scottish Cup and there is no doubt that they are on form just now.

However, after Brora's tenacious display with 10 men against Turriff, grim determination to take all 3 points home from Huntly and totally dominating last Saturday's match against Strathspey Thistle, the Reds appear to be back on course and will be hopeful of halting the Can Cans this Saturday.

Liam Baxter can expect a warm welcome back to Dudgeon Park, but hopefully he'll leave his shooting boots on the bus. His move to Forres at the start of the season seems to have worked well for him, already his clubs top scorer with 11 goals ... and his partner in crime, Lee Fraser has a tally of only one less.

The sharp and witty [@themightycans](https://twitter.com/themightycans) is a Twitter account worth following, and we're sure they won't mind that we've managed to get the above photo which we hope shows the Can Cans at training earlier this week ...

The weatherman promises another cracking day as October refuses to give way to winter ... so get your red clothes looked out and make your way to Dudgeon Park for the 3pm kick off.
