The [last time we met](/2015/09/09/nairn-away-report.html) Nairn County they were stringing together a fine run of results and were sitting 5th in the League Table. There were only 3 points between the two sides.

This time around Nairn are still in 5th spot, but we've stretched our lead over them to 21 points. It's also fair to say Brora are on a bit of a goal scoring bonanza just now. 35 goals in our last 6 matches, those goals coming from 12 different players, and Dale Gillespie and Paul Brindle on devastating form with 16 goals between them.

Brora finished 2015 with a 1-10 romp away from home to Clachnacuddin, we'll be hoping to start 2016 in exactly the same way.

Our match previews tend to concentrate on the form of ourselves and our immediate opposition. Whilst we are so close to the New Year, though, let's have a small break with tradition ... 


Those who stood in the wind and rain at Grant Street Park on Boxing day watching the 1-10 demolition of Clachnacuddin at least had the comfort of their warm and comfy homes to agonise over updates from Bellslea. With Grant Nobles 4th goal for Fraserburgh filtering through the ethernet there was a collective sigh of relief throughout Sutherland (and Inverness, Aberdeen, Banchory, Liverpool, Sauchie, Tern Alpha and countless other places the Brora supporters call home.)

This Lady isn't even making her way to the dressing room yet, never mind started warming up. But she is beginning to think about taking care of her throat in preparation for a big performance. The outcome of the 2015/16 League Championship became a huge step closer to being in our control this afternoon.

Let's see you all at Dudgeon Park on Saturday the 2nd January to help us bring in a Happy New Year.
