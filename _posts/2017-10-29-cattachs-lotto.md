As everyone involved with Brora Rangers looks forward to 'Getting our Game On' next weekend, we've got seven (thousand) reasons for you to do the same.

Our weekly Cattachs Lotto is sitting with a Jackpot of **£7,300** just waiting to be won. That's seven tantalising weeks to grab the main prize before Christmas arrives.

We've been thinking about what we'd do with a windfall like that arriving in our bank account in time for the Festive period ...

On the 23rd December it is El Clasico, Real Madrid vs Barcelona. We could pick up a couple of VIP tickets for around £700.00 each.

British Airways can take us from Inverness to Madrid on the Friday afternoon and home again on the Sunday for a measly £600.00 each. Given that we'll probably looking for some refreshments on our trip, let's add £100 and keep our travelling expenses to a round £2,000.00.

That leaves us plenty for a swanky hotel. Trip Advisor recommends Hotel Ritz. We can get a couple of rooms there for the Friday and Saturday night for another £1,200.00. We can see the Jackpot beginning to dwindle here, so we've chosen the 'Superior Rooms' rather than the £4,500.00 Deluxe Suite.

There are some particularly tempting looking restaurants in this area ... so on Friday evening it's [Tricolo](http://eltriciclo.es/triciclo/), Saturday post match has to be [El Doble](https://www.cntraveler.com/restaurants/madrid/el-doble) for beer and seafood.

We reckon we could have a pretty memorable weekend so far for £4,000.00.

We'd better get some last minute Christmas gifts bought for those that we didn't take along for the trip, though.

[This website](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-christmas-shopping-in-madrid/) should keep us in the good books and soak up the last of the change.

All in all it sounds like a great way to blow our Cattachs Lotto win ... apart from two things. We need to 'Get Our Game On' first. We will need to [download our Standing Order form from here](/lotto/), and we've already got a game away to Forres that Saturday.

El Clasico will need to wait, and we'll need to come up with another way to enjoy our Lotto win.

How would you spend the Cattachs Lotto Jackpot?
