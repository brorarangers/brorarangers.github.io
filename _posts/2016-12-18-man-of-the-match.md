Joe Malin was rewarded for his athletic, and at times acrobatic, display in the Brora goal on Saturday.

Our Match Sponsors, Brora Wanderers and Martin Ramsay, along with their guests, voted Joe as their Man of the Match after a typically courageous 90 minutes from the Club Captain.

There was a festive feel to our Match Day Hospitality with stylish headwear being sported by many.

As usual when the Wandies appear en masse at Dudgeon Park the noise levels rise, and they certainly appeared to be fortified by their pre-match meal this weekend as they sang their way through the game. Much needed against a small but exuberant Turriff Support in the Stand.

Dennis Bridgeford presented the Man of the Match award to Joe in our Sponsors Lounge after the game as well as ensuring Martin Ramsay and Jane Sutherland took a memento home of another enjoyable afternoon in the capable hands of our Hospitality organiser, Russell Jaffrey.

Our next home game is against Huntly FC on Hogmanay, with the earlier kick off time of 1pm. That makes trying to fit our usual 3 course pre-match meal in a bit problematic, but you can still enjoy some VIP treatment with our Boardroom Hospitality Package. Pre and post match drinks in the Boardroom along with half time fayre, a seat in the Stand and a guaranteed good time to round of 2016.

As usual, direct any enquiries to [Russell](mailto:russell.jaffrey@btinternet.com) or [David](mailto:david@cairngormgroup.co.uk) for further details.
