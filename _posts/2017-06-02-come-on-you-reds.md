Saturday 8th July 2017 should be a pretty happy day for fans of The Reds. But at Dudgeon Park we are the home team, so any shouts of Come on you Reds will be assumed by us to be highly partisan.

Whilst Aberdeen FC's first team will complete their pre-season fixtures against Arbroath FC at Gayfield on the 6th July, we look forward to welcoming the Premiership club to Dudgeon Park two days later for Ross Tokely's first home pre-season match.

If you've already planned your [Stornoway trip](/2017/05/11/make-your-way-to-Stornoway/) you will have had your first look at how we are shaping up for our first full season under Tokes. Saturday 8th gives you your next opportunity ... or for those Reds who are more interested in what Derek McInnes has up his sleeve for your season, this is a chance on your doorstep not to be missed.

Brexit, or no Brexit, Europe beckons for The Dons ... but not before The Dudgeon ... and there will be nothing soft about an encounter between two Clubs determined to go one better than last season.
