Ex Elgin City FC striker Craig Gunn has completed a switch to Dudgeon Park as Ross Tokely further strengthens for the upcoming campaign.

Following his release by the Scottish League 2 side Gunn was the hottest free agent in the market and the Cattachs managed to lure the Wick based striker to the club.

Gunn, who is notorious for his clinical finishing in front of goal has had a very decorated career and will hope to add Highland League success to his already well-documented personal success. Scoring over 100 goals for Elgin, he is the club's record goal scorer since their admission to the professional football ranks.

The striker began his career at Caithness United before moving on to Wick Academy and then Ross County, following his spell at Victoria Park he then went on to Peterhead and then Borough Briggs where he build his well earned reputation.

On signing the striker manager Ross Tokely was filled with excitement. He said "Managing to bring in Craig so soon after Mark Nicolson is a fantastic achievement for the club. He was very sought after and I don't think we need to ask why that was so to get him onboard is both exciting and testament to the hard work everybody is putting in to get this club in the best position for next season."

"Craig has an incredible pedigree and strong strong qualities that will definitely add to what we have here at the moment. He has committed himself to a life on the road for a long time and when somebody is that committed they truly love the game and want to succeed. I'm sure all the supporters and people involved within the club will join me in welcoming Craig to the club and wishing him well for next season."
