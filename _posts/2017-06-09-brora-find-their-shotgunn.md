Ex Elgin City FC striker Craig Gunn has completed a switch to Dudgeon Park as Ross Tokely further strengthens for the upcoming campaign.

Following his release by the Scottish League 2 side Gunn was the hottest free agent in the market and the Cattachs managed to lure the Wick based striker to the club. Gunn, who is notorious for his clinical finishing in front of goal has had a very decorated career and will hope to add Highland League success to his already well-documented personal success. Scoring over 100 goals for Elgin, he is the clubs record goal scorer since their admission to the professional football ranks. The striker began his career at Caithness United before moving on to Wick Academy and then Ross County, following his spell at Victoria Park he then went on to Peterhead and then Borough Briggs where he build his well earned reputation.
