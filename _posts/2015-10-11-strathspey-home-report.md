Brora Rangers delivered an excellent result against a team considerably better than their league position suggests. Strathspey Thistle are certainly a club going in the right direction both on and off the field. 

The game was completely controlled by a well organised Brora side and some resolute defending by the Jags defence kept the score down to three. 

Two beautifully finished moves by Paul Brindle saw the Cattachs lead 2-0 at the interval and Colin Williamson added a third in the second half. 

Nice too to have a clean sheet, something few clubs seem to be managing this season. Up to second and still bang in there.
