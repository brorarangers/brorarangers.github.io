Brora Rangers overcame dogged resistance from Strathspey Thistle to take the 3 points. This win moves Brora above Formartine to 2nd in the Highland League table behind leaders Cove Rangers whose 0-1 win at Pitmedden was their 12th consecutive league victory. 

Brora found it difficult to break through the two rows of four that Strathspey put in front of them. However, both managers thought Brora played well. As Brian Grant said, “We didn’t really get to grips with Brora, they shift the ball around well and with their players movement off the ball they are hard to mark down. They played extremely well and the best team won – I’ve no complaints with that. I’ve been here and conceded 11’s 9’s 7’s so for me 3 is not too bad. They’re a young side, a bit naïve at times but they’ll learn and come on. All credit to Brora, they work hard, their movement is fantastic with 2 fast boys on the wing and they’re very good at what they do.”

Brora player-manager Richie Brittain agreed. “I thought it was a good performance, we could have scored more goals and we had the bit between our teeth today. We looked a bit tired at times but that’s to be expected with 3 tough games in a week and the long trip to Huntly in midweek so basically I’m happy with the performance and the 3 points today. Strathspey played well and made it difficult for us at times and their keeper made some great saves but that’s taking nothing away from ourselves – we played well today.”  

Strathspey opened brightly and Scott Hume had an early chance that he lobbed over the bar and a one on one run on the Brora goal was halted by the offside flag.

Brora opened the scoring in the 18th minute when a neat inter-passing move between Zander Sutherland and Andrew Greig resulted in Greig’s cross  was headed into the far corner of the net by Paul Brindle.

Eight minutes later, Brindle added a second for the Cattachs when he finished off another Brora left wing move by slotting into the left hand corner of Strathspey keeper Michael MacCallum’s net.

Just past the half hour Zander Sutherland played in Scott Graham and his effort skidded off the crossbar and clear. Bur Strathspey threatened in their rare breaks and Brora custodian Joe Malin parried a good effort from Josh Peters over the bar. 

Five minutes before half-time Zander Sutherland’s run and through ball to Paul Brindle was cleared as the Brora number 10 looked to complete his hat-trick.

It was more of the same early in the 2nd half when Andrew Greig’s mazy run and cross was headed narrowly past the near post by Brindle. A couple of minutes after this Greig was pulled down on the edge of the box by Strathspey’s Jordan Wardrope although the ball reached Brindle who  was clean though on goal. Rather than play advantage, the referee blew for the foul which frustrated the Brora team and fans. 

The pattern of Brora creating a lot of chances with the odd Strathspey breakaway continued and was not changed when Strathspey replaced Josh Race and Stuart Patience with Kane Hull and Owen Cairns on the hour.

After Brora replaced Dale Gillespie with player-manager Richie Brittain a Zander Sutherland run and pile-driver was acrobatically parried away by Strathspey’s ex-Nairn County keeper Michael MacCallum in the 75th minute.

A minute later Brora finally converted one of their conveyor-belt of chances when a great flowing move was finished by full-back Colin Williamson for the 3rd goal.

Brora then gave promising young Orcadian full-back John Pickles a run out by replacing Grant Munro and moving Colin Williamson alongside Scott Houston at centre-back.  

The home side continued to bombard the Strathspey goal and 10 minutes from time Richie Brittain drove a 25 yard free kick from centre-right of the box narrowly wide of the far post. However there was no more scoring and the match ended at 3-0 with both managers satisfied with the outcome.
