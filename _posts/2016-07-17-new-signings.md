Key midfielder Dale Gillespie, has extended his contract until 2019,and top striker Steven Mackay has signed a further two year deal taking him up to 2018. Club Manager Grant Munro was delighted that the pair have committed themselves to the club and it is further evidence of the ambitions of Brora Rangers. Gillespie commented “ I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Brora, and have enjoyed great success. I’m determined to play my part in returning the Press and Journal Highland League flag to Dudgeon Park. His colleague “Sid” Mackay was equally delighted at the new contract and with him hopefully not being abroad with his work so frequently during the coming season, we can expect to see him banging in the goals as usual.  
 
Adding to the Cattachs  ranks this coming season will be new signings  Craig Campbell and Callum MacDonald. Craig has played  in all three preseason friendlies this year and has found the net on each occasion, with another impressive strike against Inverness City on Saturday. “ I’m delighted to have signed for Brora and have some unfinished business here. I have been really enjoying the training and the friendly match experiences and am looking forward to the start of the new campaign”
 
The ex Stirling University and Falkirk Juniors defender Callum MacDonald is also an addition to the Brora squad. Callum has still to finish his studies at Stirling University so wont be available throughout the season, but he is a quality player and a real catch for the squad.
 
In a further bit of good news,Lewis Grant,who himself is off to University,has confirmed his availability for the coming year,and this is a real boon for the team.Lewis a product of the ICT youth system, has developed rapidly during his time with Brora Rangers. “Lewis has filled out over the course of the last 6 months and is playing with a great degree of self belief and confidence” said Grant Munro. “ It’s great news he wants to travel back at the weekends to play for Brora and I’m sure he has a great future in the game”.
 
Speaking on behalf of the Board,William Powrie welcomed the new signings to the club and was delighted that Dale and Sid had extended their contracts. “ These are important contracts and illustrate the continued ambition of the club. Hopefully we will be able to announce the signing of a couple of further additions this week. We have been actively tracking 4/5 possibilities, and Grant Munro and I will be meeting these players this week,with the aim of bringing a further two exciting prospects to the club.
