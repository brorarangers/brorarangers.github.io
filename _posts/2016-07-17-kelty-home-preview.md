Much like last weekend's opponents, Kelty Hearts are a fairly recent addition to the Scottish Junior Football ranks. But that hasn't prevented them from achieving significant success.

Formed in 1975 as Kelty Hearts Amateur Football Club with the express intent of bringing Junior Football back to the Fife village, the Committee achieved their aim within 5 years, though not without some hardship along the way. 

A young, untested manager took Kelty Hearts to second place in their first season in the Fife Junior League. He had a pretty successful time managing his next team too, as any Dunfermline Athletic fan who was around in the 80s will remember well.

Within 10 years the Club had it's hands on it's first Fife Junior League Championship, a feat they repeated another 5 times. Now playing in the East Super League, they were Champions in season 2014-15 and runners-up last season. Add in the runner up medals the squad collected in the Scottish Junior Cup back in 1999 and 2007 and it all adds up to a well organised Club with plenty of ambition.

Talking of ambition, we head into this final friendly match on the back of a hugely satisfying pre-season to prepare us for what is bound to be a highly competitive League campaign. Strong performances against Forfar, Inverness Caledonian City and Ross County; a strong management and coaching team raring to go along with several stalwarts of previous seasons committing to a future proudly wearing the Cattach; and the likelihood of more signing news this week. It is all shaping up to be a memorable season.

In our usual optimistic attempt at weather forecasting, it's going to be a scorcher. It's back to the traditional 3pm kick-off on Saturday, this weekend you can leave the umbrella at home. With the prices at the gate reduced to £5.00 and £3.00 concessions it should be an ideal afternoon to introduce a friend to the Brora Rangers experience.
