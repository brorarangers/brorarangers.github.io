The most difficult post match decision to be made after this titanic  Cattachs performance would be choosing a Man of the Match, in a game where all eleven players plus substitutes gave everything and played the previously unbeaten Cove Rangers off the park. 

The 2-0 scoreline barely did Brora credit given their dominance, and a 5-0 outcome would not have been unrepresentative, such was the performance of Brora Rangers. 

This pivotal victory puts Brora 6 points ahead of Cove at the top of the P&J Highland League, and whilst Cove have 3 games in hand, points on the board  at this time of the season are always preferable, and the race for the Championship has been blown wide open. 

Speaking after the game player manager Richard Brittain praised his players for their application and commitment and declared that his, and the teams eyes are firmly fixed on retaining their championship crown 

Referee Douglas Ross had to inspect the pitch an hour before the game as the morning frost was reluctant to lift, but gave the go ahead despite parts of the shaded surface being a little icy. A minute silence was observed in memory of George Cormack a loyal supporter and helper at the club who died suddenly earlier in the week. 

Brora were forced to leave out Gavin Morrision following his injury last week at Keith, whilst Sutherland, Gillespie and MacDonald all carried knocks but were pronounced fit to play after sessions on the physiotherapy bench. 

From the off Brora went at Cove and both Macleod and Sutherland went close in the opening minutes.The Cove keepers hands will have been nicely warmed after a rapier drive from Sutherland brought the best out of the Stuart Mackenzie shortly thereafter.

Richard Brittain opened the scoring in 14 minutes when he picked up on a mistimed clearance and planted his 25 yard drive past the Cove keeper. The relief around the terraces was audible and a just reward for Brora's early persistence.

Both Sutherland and Brittain were in full flow and again the Cove keeper was kept busy to deny both the Brora pairing. Likewise John Macleod now settling right into his new surroundings was far too much of a handful for Cove defenders whom could not get to grips with him at all. Macleod nearly added a second after 35 minutes but a desperate block from the lunging Kelly prevented him connecting cleanly. 

Cove's only chance of the half fell to the usually clinical Daryl Nicol but Scott Houston produced the tackle of the match before Nicol had chance to unload. 

Despite several other very near misses there was no further scoring in the first half and Cove would feel themselves lucky to go in at the break just one down.

As the air temperature fell further in the second half Brora turned up the heat on the park. Despite a change of formation at the break, Cove rarely challenged the Brora goal and spent the second period "manning the pumps" at the back and repelling the red tidal wave. 

Martin Maclean and Dale Gillespie continued to dominate the middle of the park, feeding both Greig and Sutherland over the top and Cove had no answer to the wingers speed.

Having run his heart out John Macleod was replaced by Paul Brindle who simply picked up from where his team mate left off and immediately had the Cove back line in trouble with his runs and visionary distribution. On one such occasion he found Sutherland with a pin point ball, who lobbed the keeper only to see his shot cleared off the line by Eric Watson. 

Whilst the score remained at 1-0 there was always a possibility that Cove could sneak an equaliser, and perhaps Stuart Duff should have done better, but fired his shot into the side netting. 

The game was however settled in the 84th minute when Paul Brindle picked up a great ball from Zander Sutherland and he confidently slotted it passed the advancing Stuart Mackenzie.
