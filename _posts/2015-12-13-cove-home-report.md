The most difficult post match decision to be made after this titanic  Cattachs performance would be choosing a Man of the Match, in a game where all eleven players plus substitutes gave everything and played the previously unbeaten Cove Rangers off the park. 

The 2-0 scoreline barely did Brora credit such was their dominance, and a 5-0 outcome would not have been unrepresentative, such was the performance of Brora Rangers. 

From the off Brora were at Cove and the Aberdeen outfit were pushed onto the back foot as the Brora front line ran them ragged. 

Richard Brittain opened the scoring with a powerful 20 yard drive and despite several other very near misses Cove could feel themselves lucky to go in at the break just one down. 

As the air temperature fell in the second half Brora turned up the heat on the park, and substitute Paul Brindle bagged all 3 points with another well taken goal and sent all those on and off the park into scenes celebration.
