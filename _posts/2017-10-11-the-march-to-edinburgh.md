This weekend it's time for the Highlanders to march on Edinburgh once again. If this conjures up pictures of the Jacobites heading south back in 1745 to capture the city ... good.

Except, unlike this weekend, there would have been scarce few Cattachs setting out with Charles Edward Stuart back then.  

Supporting a cause for restoring the crown to the old order was never close to the hearts of the clans of Sutherland. Back then we were glad to see the dominance of the House of Stuart broken by the invitation of William & Mary to take the country's top spot. Today's Cattach's were delighted to see the dominance of the Shire clubs over the past few decades broken and claim the League crown for ourselves for a couple of seasons.

Truth is, we want that crown back. And if a march to Edinburgh is required to serve up a Scottish Cup win to help us in our quest, to Edinburgh we are ready to march.

The Supporters Club bus is booked, travel plans are afoot for those no longer resident on the direct route down the A9, and the advance army already based around the Lothians are ready to mobilise to Muirhouse.

If you still can't shake that picture of a Highland army marching confidently into Scotland's Capital this weekend ... good. The Red and White Army that follow us around the League and around the country are vital to our success. Those fans who were part of the players' celebrations last weekend at Harmsworth Park will confirm that.

So, if your plans for the weekend don't already include a trip to Christie Gillies Park, now is the time to get organised. There isn't much space left on the Supporters Club bus, but at £25 for a return trip it's worth getting in touch with them to book a seat.

As for all our old friends in the Brora Rangers Supporters Club (Edinburgh Branch) we look forward to meeting up again.

It's a pay at the gate affair - Adults £6.00 with £3.00 Concessions and Civil Service Strollers are also producing a Match Programme priced at £2.00.

**See you all on Saturday**
