One of our roving website reporters has been spotted pacing around Dudgeon Park several times over the past couple of days as Brora has been subjected to it's first real frosts of the winter.

It was always unlikely that the warm breath from his muttering and repeated requests for a loan of Mr Norris' hairdryer would cause enough of a thaw to soften his beloved turf. A fall of snow on Thursday night appeared to shift relatively quickly on Friday mid morning raising hopes almost as much as the faltering temperature.

It is at this time of year that avoiding postponements can add to the advantage over our fellow challengers, and with Cove Rangers match against Wick Academy called off earlier today it was a chance for both Formartine Utd and ourselves to make hay whilst a wintry sun shone.

However, it's not to be and tomorrow's meeting with fort William will be postponed until a later date. Along with those planning heading along to Cove v Wick, Keith v Turriff and Huntly v Buckie (so far) it's time to think about something else to occupy your Saturday afternoon.

You don't need to think too hard about how to occupy yourself on the evening of the [19th February](/2016/01/15/hall-of-fame-dinner.html) though.
