After two weeks on the road Brora Rangers return back to Dudgeon Park for our alternative local derby against Clachnacuddin.

The return to our home ground will give us the wide pitch which suits our style of play so much. I'm sure Richard Brittain and the boys will be looking to build on last weeks win and keep the pressure on league leaders Cove who are without a league fixture this Saturday.

Clacnacuddin have struggled for consistency so far this term but are always dangerous opponents and Brora will need to be on their game if they are to lift the 3 points.

This fixture always attracts a good crowd and with the forecast looking good for Saturday, why not come along and cheer on the Cattachs.
