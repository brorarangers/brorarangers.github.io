Brora Rangers comfortably took all 3 points home from Christie Park on Saturday, after another clinical performance when they beat Huntly 6-1. 

Brora left out John Pickles and Paul Brindle from midweek, both of whom were carrying knocks that had not fully responded to treatment. There were periods of play where their performance was reminiscent of the game against Lossiemouth on Wednesday, as they stroked the ball around with grace and skill. 

However it could have been different if Huntly forward Duncanson  had finished better after some good work and and excellent cross from Duff wide on the right. 

Having survived that early scare, Brora settled down and Gillespie, Morrison and Maclean soon took control of the midfield and the game. Indeed Maclean nearly opened the scoring in 9 minutes, but the keeper gathered his powerful header. A minute later Craig Campbell should really have scored, but his shot found the side netting. 

The Cattachs were not going to be denied for too much longer and on 13 minutes Zander Sutherland latched onto a long clearance from Joe Malin and beat Pennycook with his well placed finish. 

The goal further settled the Brora nerves and they played some lovely interchange football, with Maclean, Mackay, Campbell and Sutherland all forcing good saves from Pennycook.

On 23 minutes Huntly very nearly equalised when Duff crossed well, but Joe Malin managed to get a fist to the ball and cleared the danger. 

Brora continued to dominate and played some lovely football. Martin Maclean was the playmaker and he effortlessly stroked the ball around the park. It was however another midfield dynamo Gavin Morrison who fired home Brora's second through a crowded penalty area. 

Steven Mackay was always dangerous, and in the 43rd minute he was upended by Webb and the referee had the easiest of decisions to make in awarding the penalty which was converted by Dale Gillespie. 

Huntly started the second half a little brighter, but found themselves 4-0 down, when "man of the match" Colin Williamson rose above the defence to head home a Sutherland corner. 

In the 74th minute substitute Andrew Grieg, fired home with his first touch of the match, and Scott Lisle was not too far away with a great strike as Brora continued to hold the Huntly goal under siege. 

Matthew MacDonald pulled one back for Huntly with a close in effort following a cross from the left, but it was down to Steven Mackay to bring the curtain down with a cheeky flicked back heel to add Brora's 6th. 

This was another very accomplished Brora performance against a useful Huntly side that put 4 past Wick last week. With a modicum of luck it could have been 10, but more important were the 3 points and another great squad performance.
