Nairn County defeated Brora Rangers very much against the odds at Dudgeon Park to throw the title race wide open. 


Although Brora had it in their own hands going into this match, Cove Rangers recent stumbles against Fraserburgh and Inverurie Locos means that Formartine United are now lurking menacingly in what is developing into a 3-way tussle for the crown. As such, Brora’s visit to Formartine on Saturday now assumes crucial importance in the destination of the title.

 
Nairn had been beaten 4-1 at home by mid-table Keith in their previous match and Brora had thrashed Clach 10-1 at Grant Street so this result was against form and not many would have predicted it. Nairn lined up in a formation designed to contain free-scoring Brora, sitting back and trying to hit the Cattachs on the break. 
 
It looked like normal service in the first half when Paul Brindle put the champions ahead on 9 minutes after a short corner between Zander Sutherland and Andrew Greig resulted in the latter’s left wing cross being collected by Brindle who shot high into the net. Brindle had a glorious chance to double his and Brora’s tally in the 27th minute when his first effort was blocked and an excellent tackle by Sean Webb prevented him converting the rebound and 10 minutes later his goal-bound shot was brilliantly held on the line by Nairn keeper Antell. A minute later, Grant Munro’s strong header was blocked on the line by Sam Urquhart. So it was desperate last ditch defending that stopped the wee County from being 3 or four goals down at half time.

Grant Munro came off at half time with an injury resulting in Dale Gillespie dropping to centre back and Martin MacLean replacing him in midfield. Although Brora bossed possession in the first half Nairn, having weathered the storm, came more out of their shell so the second half was more end to end with chances and half chances at both ends. Indeed, just 3 minutes after the restart Nairn’s ex-Clach man Sam Urquhart’s drive was just a whisker wide of the far post. On 63 minutes, Nairn drew level with their first shot on target. Tony Wallace picked up a loose ball on the left hand edge of the box and his low effort curled away from Joe Malin and went into the net off the inside of the far post. 
 
Brora were now going for broke for the 3 points and replaced wide man Andrew Greig with central striker John MacLeod. They did create several chances but it seemed to be one of those days when every shot was blocked or deflected and every loose ball fell to a Nairn defender. However, Nairn were determined and broke at every opportunity, flooding men forward to support their attacks. The fact that Brora were committed to trying to find a winner meant there were gaps at the back and 3 minutes from time Nairn exploited this to the full when they broke in numbers. Connor Gethins effort looked to be on target but was blocked. The loose ball fell to Nairn midfield general Robbie Duncanson and he made no mistake from 10 yards to seal what was in many ways a smash and grab win.

Brora player-manager Richie Brittain was frustrated but philosophical. “It certainly wasn’t the result we were looking for. We are disappointed with our performance and the fact we were unable to take anything from the game. We were 1-0 up at half time and had 2 or 3 good chances to add to that but it’s all ifs, buts and maybes. I have to give credit to Nairn in the 2nd half – they kept us penned in at times and certainly took their chances when they came along later in the match so well done to them.”
 
Les Fridge was delighted after the way the second half unfolded. “This is a great 3 points for us. I watched them win 10-1 at Clach last weekend and decided to change things around a little bit to try and combat their system. We hit them more on the break which is something we don’t often do. Our set-up certainly worked today. Not many teams will come away from here with 3 points, that’s for sure.”
