Brora suffered an unexpected set back in their quest for a third Highland League title, when they were beaten by a determined Nairn County outfit 2-1 at Dudgeon Park on Saturday afternoon. 

On a cold and blustery afternoon, Brora started the more brightly with the Nairn County keeper kept busy in the opening minutes. 

The strong wind was making football difficult, but it was Brora who had more control of the ball and deservedly took the lead in the 11th minute when Brindle netted from close quarters. 

The remainder of the half saw Brora create and squander several good chances, Nairn could have secured an equaliser after 44 minutes, but Joe Malin was alert to the danger and made a last ditch tackle at the edge of his box. 

Despite a strengthening wind at their backs, Brora never really settled and passes rarely found their man. As the game progressed Brora became increasingly rugged in their play and it was Nairn who looked more likely to score, and indeed they deservedly equalised in the 63rd minute when Wallace curled  in a shot from 15 yards around Malin and off the inside of the far post.

The final 30 minutes saw chances for both sides, and as Brora tried to push forward for the winner, Nairn always looked dangerous on the break and on 86 minutes Duncanson  found himself unmarked and fired home what was to prove the match winner.
