New Year Predictions? That's a bit of a misleading headline, as we'll be making no attempt to guess how the current battle at the top of the Highland League is going to end. However, it's worth a look forward to what we see as some of the potential crunch games if only for a bit of entertainment to follow on from our Festive football Reviews [Part 1](/2015/12/29/hogmanay-review.html), [Part 2](/2015/12/30/hogmanay-review-2.html) and [Part 3](/2015/12/31/hogmanay-review-3.html).

First into the New Year action are ourselves and Nairn County.
