New Year Predictions? That's a bit of a misleading headline, as we'll be making no attempt to guess how the current battle at the top of the Highland League is going to end. However, it's worth a look forward to what we see as some of the potential crunch games if only for a bit of entertainment to follow on from our Festive football Reviews [Part 1](/2015/12/29/hogmanay-review.html), [Part 2](/2015/12/30/hogmanay-review-2.html) and [Part 3](/2015/12/31/hogmanay-review-3.html).

First into the New Year action are ourselves and Nairn County on the 2nd, with Cove hosting Inverurie Locos at Spain Park and Formartine travelling to Keith the following day. That's first place v fifth, and second place v sixth, along with Formartine facing a revitalised Keith side under Allan Hale. That's three potential banana skins before we get past the 3rd of the month. The Locos have already inflicted some damage to Formartine's points total and held Cove close the last time round.

Saturday the 9th of January sees massive games for the top 3. Whilst Cove Rangers head down to Fir Park to meet Motherwell in the 4th Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup, we travel to North Lodge Park in what will be a hugely important game for both ourselves and Formartine Utd. It's a potential '6-pointer' game, not only will both sides want the 3 points, but the opportunity of robbing the opposition of a win is a hugely attractive prospect, especially with Cove missing from the League fixtures and falling a further game behind. (We really are doing our best to avoid the worst of the [football cliches](http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/lists/113876/15-downright-detestable-football-punditry-cliches.html) here, but, points on the board and all that ...).

Two games in to the New Year, and already we're making wild assumptions about the weather. We've seen 11 Highland League fixtures fall foul of waterlogged pitches so far this season, and the worst of the winter is doubtless yet to come. However, along with injuries and suspensions, the weather can cause headaches as schedules become disrupted and fixtures start to pile up.

If all goes to plan, the following weekend looks like a tougher weekend for our challengers as Cove host Wick and Formartine head to Fraserburgh. We meet Fort William at Dudgeon Park, and this time they don't have [John McLeod](/2015/11/17/john-macleod.html). Fraserburgh have already recorded a draw and a win against Cove, so we'll be hoping they gain revenge for their 0-1 defeat last time round when they met the Pitmedden side in mid September. (Coincidentally, the same weekend Cove recorded a slim 0-1 victory at Harmsworth Park)

Onwards, then, to what is currently scheduled as a weekend off for Formartine Utd due to the preliminary rounds of the Breedon Aggregates League Cup and Cove travel to Station Park to meet Nairn County who they thumped 6-1 in their home fixture. Brora travel to Turriff. Last years runners up, and with the memory of holding us to a [draw at home](/2015/10/05/turriff-home-report.html) in our first meeting this season, this is likely to be the fixture of the weekend.

The final Saturday in January should see Huntly come to Dudgeon Park, Cove host Deveronvale at North Lodge Park and Formartine meet Nairn at Station Park. On paper, no changes at the top of the League ... on paper. (That was almost a prediction there, but not quite. Huntly have already [run us close](/2015/10/07/huntly-away-report.html))

The first weekend in February is set aside for [League Cup business](/2015/12/17/league-cup-draw.html) bringing us nicely into the next **big** game of the run in. Whilst we head down to Grantown on Spey, Cove and Formartine clash at Harlaw Park. This was a narrow home win for Cove back in October, who knows what will happen this time round, but it is bound to have an effect on the final positions of both sides by the time the League is wrapped up.

At present, there is only one weekend scheduled for League fixtures in March, but doubtless there will be a bit of catch up to be done due to the weather earlier in the year, along with League Cup fixtures. Whilst we host Inverurie Locos, Turriff Utd also get another chance to influence the outcome of the 2015/16 Championship when they entertain Formartine Utd.

If we are all caught up by the time we enter April, we'll all have 2 games left and we are guessing (not predicting, just guessing) that the final positions and ultimate 2015/16 League Champions may still yet be undecided. 

Which is really going to add to the spice of our first visit to Harmsworth Park of the season, another [North Derby](/2015/11/12/wick-home-report.html) on the 2nd April, that's going to be a humdinger of a match.

Let's be honest, all the above flimflam may add to the anticipation of our next 10 League games, but who does what away from our own results should matter little if we continue our form over the past 13 League games.
