Brora Rangers surrendered their record breaking unbeaten run when they lost to Cove Rangers 3-0 at Harlaw Park,Inverurie yesterday. 

Brora never really got to grips with the small tight pitch and the very solid Cove Rangers defence had little difficulty in handling the Brora front line. 

Cove took an early lead when Jamie Watt poked home from 2 yards after some sloppy defending. 

Brora had the lions share of play in the first half but produced few real chances . Cove held out and went into the break with a 1-0 lead in what was an enjoyable first half. 

Turning point of the game was probably Zander Sutherland's penalty miss,with Stuart McKenzie saving well low to his right.

Within 3 minutes Cove were two up when Steven McKay was dispossessed in his own half and the resultant pass saw Daryl Nicol slot home after he cut through a square Brora defence. 

With Brora pushing to get back into the game, Cove further extended their lead with a magnificent strike again from Man of the Match Nicol. 

The last 15 minutes saw Brora lose shape and heads went down. Cove smashed a free kick onto the inside of the post with Malin well beaten. 

Steven Mackay should have pulled one back when clear on goal but his effort summed up a poor day at the office for the Cattachs. 

As our shape disappeared so did our discipline and we picked up four unnecessary yellow cards. 

A very rare set back for Brora and upon reflection one could argue that there was not three goals between the teams. However, Cove have signalled their intentions for the season and Brora will need a significant bounce back next week at Fraserburgh.
