'Revenge is a dish best served cold', so the saying goes. Given the amount of games across Scotland that fell foul of the weather last weekend, it is possibly foolhardy to look at the forecast for Saturday's crunch game so soon ... but here goes anyway.

Pretty good for this time of year, and pretty much ensures that whether Brora Rangers exact revenge for the earlier defeat at the hands of Cove Rangers or not, it will definitely be cold.

According to the [Highland League website](http://www.highlandfootballleague.com/Fixtures/) the two teams have met 27 times in the past, with Cove winning 18 times and 6 draws. Does that have any bearing on our next meeting? Probably not. Brora's recent form over the past 3 seasons mean that those stats go out the window. Cove's form this season though, now that's a different matter.

Cove haven't lost a League game this season so far, with only Fraserburgh being able to hold them to a 3-3 draw back in November. It could be argued that the 3 goal difference between ourselves and Cove at our last meeting didn't reflect how close the teams really were ... but the 3 points Cove took from the game can't be argued with. Without a doubt, they are the team to beat this season.

Two seasons ago Brora played Cove at the start of their first League Championship year. The side that took the field that day showed exactly what Brora's intentions were for the rest of the season and made a few teams sit up and notice just how clinical the Cattach's could be as they dominated the then League Champions in a 0-3 away victory. The spine of that Brora team will take to the park again this Saturday, along with some of the new signings who have pulled on our shirt since then ... Paul Brindle and John McLeod have shown their goal scoring abilities, John Pickles has shown what he can add to our defence and how quick he can be to open up play.

If Cove have a chink in their armour, Brora are just the team to exploit it. The problem is, Cove haven't shown many chinks in their armour so far. They have only conceded 12 League goals to date and Brora are going to have to be back to their clinical best when it comes to taking any opportunities which present themselves to bury the ball in the back of Cove's net.

It's a huge game for both sides. It's guaranteed to be a fantastic afternoon's entertainment, let's face it, it's bound to be cold, but we are confident revenge can be served.

Get yourselves up to Dudgeon Park in plenty of time to get your hands on our [Christmas merchandise](/2015/11/28/christmas-merchandise.html) too. We thought travelling up from Sauchie to get the Christmas shopping done was a superb commitment - now we find one of our ex-pat Reds is making the trip from Liverpool! Anyone care to beat that?

See you all on Saturday!
