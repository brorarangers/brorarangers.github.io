Friday night will see another two Brora Rangers Football Club legends inaugurated into our Hall of Fame.

Last year's event was hugely entertaining, with MC Ian Thain keeping everyone right on the night, and the hugely entertaining Craig Brown regaling us with tales of managing and coaching both at club level and during his tenure as Scotland Boss.

This year promises to be no less of an occasion as Ian joins us again whilst Kenny Clark will provide an insight into the life of the Man in Black at both domestic and International level.

Tickets for the event, to be held at the Dudgeon Park Community Centre, are still available at Â£40 each, which includes a generous buffet meal.

Get in touch with [brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com](mailto:brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com) to book a night of mirth and memories, and help celebrate those who have been written in to the Brora Rangers history books.
