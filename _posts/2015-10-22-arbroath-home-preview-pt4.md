Enough about a [game in 1956](/2015/10/21/arbroath-home-preview-pt3.html), not that we don't think that it is time the 6-1 loss was avenged, but we do have some more recent history to look at.

Back in July last year Brora Rangers travelled down to Gayfield for a pre-season friendly which resulted in a 2-2 draw. Pre-season games are rarely a true measure of how a competitive game will finish, and a game from 2 seasons ago could possibly foretell even less. However, there are some things about this game worth having a look at before we meet up again on Saturday.

Brora took a squad of 14 to the match; Malin, Porrit, Williamson, Tokely, Gillespie, Morrison, J Mackay, M Maclean, Sutherland, S Mackay & Graham all started. Colin Maclean and Andrew Grieg replacing S Mackay and J Mackay respectively later in the game, with John Allan the only player to be left on the bench.

That's not a million miles away from the squad that will meet Arbroath again on Saturday. Gavin and Colin Williamson were the scorers in July 2014. 

Arbroath made it into the 5th Round of the Scottish Cup with their squad. Brora Rangers made it into the 4th Round for the first time in our history.

The tale of our Scottish Cup campaign of 2014/15 is exactly why you want to be at Dudgeon Park on Saturday, this just might be the start of another exciting, entertaining and record breaking journey.

As League Champions we entered the Cup in the 2nd Round, with a home tie against Banks o' Dee. The Aberdeen club had beaten Rothes 0-4 at MacKessack Park in the first round, but Brora were to go one better.

Captain Steven Mackay opened the scoring in just under 4 mins, and completed his hat trick 20 minutes later. Martin Maclean claimed goal number 4 just before half time and Gavin Morrison finished the business in the 78th minute. Steven's second goal was voted Goal of the Round winning 58% of the public vote ... there was some [stiff competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U-j7QILBkQ), including Nairn's Robbie Duncanson.

The draw for the 3rd round took place on the following Monday and Billy Connelly and William Hill's Margaret Batchelor decided Brora were destined to travel to Meadowbank Stadium. Edinburgh City had knocked us out of the Cup in 2011/12 with a 3-0 victory in the capital.

This time round City had knocked Auchinleck Talbot out in the 1st round in a game that saw 5 bookings and a dismissal for Auchinleck's Number 7 in the 23rd minute.

The Edinburgh side managed to pick up another two yellows and a red of their own in the tightly contested game against Brora. They opened the scoring in the first two minutes to shock the large travelling support - a fantastic strike from Ian MacFarland from just outside the box. The Reds don't take well to losing to sides who play in Black and White. Colin Williamson levelled the score in the 6th minute and Gavin's deflected free kick 15 minutes later put the Cattachs in the lead.

Just before half time an audacious chip from Zander into the path of Andrew Grieg saw our nippy winger put us ahead by 2 goals. Further attempts on goal in the second half by Sid and Zander, followed by a red card for City's Ross Allum gave the Brora support plenty to sing about, slightly tempered by John Dunn's rocket of a shot in the 71st minute ... City 2-3 Brora. However, Brora piled on the pressure and Stobie was forced to save shots from Scott Graham, Gavin Morrison and Steven Mackay before the referee finally blew the whistle for full time. And the Reds marched on to the 4th round of the William Hill Scottish Cup.

**Convinced you really can't afford to miss our Scottish Cup game yet?**

There was a palpable air of excitement both in the village and for Cattachs spread around the world by lunchtime on the 3rd of November. The draw was due to take place at 2pm, and the Brora Rangers Supporters Club Facebook Page had been very busy for days as arguments were put forward for who the fans wanted in the next round ... we were the last Highland League club in the competition, but should the Club be keeping their fingers crossed for a home tie with Junior side Bo'ness Utd, or was this our chance to meet one of the SPL teams on their home turf with the promise of a bumper crowd? Spartans at home or Celtic away? Stirling Albion at Dudgeon Park or Rangers at Ibrox?

As it was, Brora had another long trip to look forward to. 288 miles to Palmerston Park, home of Championship contenders Queen of the South. The Doonhamers had Scottish Cup history alright, losing 2-3 to Rangers in the final in 2008 for example.

Undaunted, our fantastic Supporters Club organised a bus, hotel rooms were booked, train tickets bought (especially by those who got their Over 55s bargain and travelled via Carlisle and every other train station between Gretna and Brora), car trips organised and time off booked. The Cattachs were ready to paint Dumfries Red and White.

Queen of the South TV published terrific highlights of the game, there is no need for us to talk much more about the football played, the 12 minute video captured most of the onfield events perfectly.

Whilst the video also does a great job of capturing the noise, passion and bagpipes of the Brora support, it just can't do justice to the spirit in which the game was played. The spirit of a truly great Scottish Cup tie.

The video doesn't show the welcome that the Cattachs received in Dumfries, it doesn't capture the genuine pleasure the Doonhamers showed in seeing a travelling support which they told us outnumbered most of their Championship opponents that season. It can't show the atmosphere of being part of a huge Scottish Cup game.

Whilst it catches the Brora Rangers squad approaching their loyal followers to applaud their tireless singing, shouting and bagpipe playing, it misses the fact that the Queen of the South players made a similar gesture to the travelling support. It misses the fact that the Brora squad received a mighty roar and standing ovation from the home fans. We had them them on the back foot for a while, every Brora player on the pitch played out of their skin that afternoon, every player on the pitch knew it, every supporter, regardless of the colour of their scarf, knew it.

**This is the Scottish Cup. It's the oldest national trophy still currently contested in the world. Brora Rangers go head to head with Arbroath this Saturday for the right to proceed to the next round.**

**Honest, you really don't want to miss the chance of being part of this.**
