Brora Rangers FC Under 15s and Under 17s are currently seeking new main sponsors to help fund their 2015/2016 season. Both teams currently compete in the North of Scotland Leagues and fulfil 16 fixtures per season which comes at a cost to the Club, which only generates the vital funds through sponsorship programmes. 

The Youth teams are in need of new kit and equipment and we are encouraging any business to get involved and help us continue the great work that has been put in to developing this part of the club. Keeping our Youth teams going is a vital part of BRFCâ€™s place in the heart of the community and it is key that we continue to offer local youngsters their chance to develop and grow on and off the field with us. 

Any parties that may be able to help us are urged to contact Dale Pryde-MacDonald on 07826 542 911 or via email [dale_john31@hotmail.com](mailto:dale_john31@hotmail.com)
