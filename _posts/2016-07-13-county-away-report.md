Ross County, having returned from their Hungarian trip, entertained Brora Rangers in a "behind closed doors" match at Jubilee Park Dingwall on Tuesday evening.

Whilst County fielded their first eleven over the two periods, Brora went into the game without several stalwarts. Missing  were Messers MacDonald, Pickles, Munro, Houston and Morrison, but the centre back pairing on the night of Williamson and Ross did look especially good, as did Lewis Grant who continues to mature into an exceptionally useful player. 

The first half was goalless with County enjoying the majority of possession but neither side created too many clear cut chances. Zander Sutherland looked to have opened the scoring, but his shot was fired into the side netting. 

The second half saw a more open and counter attacking match, with both sides stepping up the tempo. It was County who scored first when Morrison tapped in from close range after some neat inter passing moves wide on the left. 

Brora equalised through Campbell shortly after when the striker took advantage following a mistake in the back ranks of the County defence, and drove the ball past McCarey. 

Morrison restored the County advantage in a similar manner to his first, after good supporting work from Boyce. However with customary tenacity Martin Maclean  equalised for the Cattachs after some excellent work in midfield. 

On a less promising note, Paul Brindle seemed to pull his hamstring and was forced to leave the field in great discomfort early in the second half.
