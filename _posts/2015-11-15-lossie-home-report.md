Brora Rangers emerged victorious from a one-sided match where they had to exercise patience to break down the backs-to-the wall resistance of a hard-working Lossiemouth side.  

Lossiemouth’s game plan was to contain and smother – park the bus in front of the goal in Jose Mourinho’s memorable phrase. They played a 4-5-1formation with lone striker Ross Archibald working his socks off tracking back and trying to feed off scraps. This was a surprisingly unambitious formation for a much-improved Lossie side this season who, under Charlie Charlesworth have won almost as many games as they have lost and are now more a mid-table side than down among the also-rans.  

Brora fielded an unchanged line-up from the team who won the midweek north derby against Wick Academy in midweek and started in the same manner as they finished the Wick game – on the front foot. 

They had overwhelming possession from the kick off and would have won by a more convincing margin than 2-0 but for a little luck and an outstanding performance by ex-Deveronvale keeper Darren MacConnachie who had 2 truly exceptional stops among his many saves.

The Cattachs decided to get round the crowded midfield and defence by playing wide. The team as a whole played well in an entertaining game and Dale Gillespie and Gavin Morrison both had an excellent game as the attacking midfield fulcrum through which most of Brora’s moves flowed as did both Zander Sutherland and Andrew Greig on the flanks, ably abetted by the overlapping runs of John Pickles and Ally MacDonald. Given the amount of chances they carved out, including 2 disallowed goals, the margin of victory was surprisingly narrow. 

The pattern of the game was typified by an almighty goalmouth stramash in the 11th minute when a header from an Andrew Greig cross was blocked, the follow-up was blocked once again and then yet again at the near post. This was followed a 20 yard drive by Martin MacLean clawed away by Darren MacConnachie at the right hand junction of post and bar, a John Pickles cross blocked as Zander Sutherland drove it goalwards and Steven MacKay taking an extra touch so the rebound was also blocked. Then Andrew Greig had a go himself, cutting in after a left wing run and shot right across the face of the goal but the angle was a little too oblique. Then it was Steven MacKay’s turn to shoot across the face of the goal. 

Lossie’s goal was leading a charmed life but it couldn’t continue and it was finally breached in the 36th minute when Zander Sutherland’s cross following yet another right wing run was deflected into his own net by the unfortunate Kevin Flett who was the pick of the Lossie defenders. Shortly after this, the Coasters switched winger William Mathers to left back with Jordan Main moving into the middle as he had had a torrid time trying to cope with Zander Sutherland’s pace and trickery on the flank. 

The onslaught continued, however, and Zander Sutherland was just a whisker away from connecting with a beautifully weighted ball threaded through the middle by Dale Gillespie and Darren MacConnachie did well to hold a powerful Grant Munro goal-bound header and yet another Andrew Greig drive screamed just wide of the near post. Ben Dempster’s half-time whistle must have been greeted with relief by Lossie!

The relief was short-lived however because a couple of minutes into second half the next referee’s whistle was to award Brora a penalty after Zander Sutherland’s right wing run ended when he was felled in the box by Christopher Ross. Dale Gillespie converted emphatically. Although the impressive Lossie keeper Darren MacConnachie got a good hand to it there was too much power in the shot to stop in nestling in the net to put the Champions 2-0 up. 

This pattern continued with the highlights being Martin MacLean blazing over the bar when he should have scored following a great right wing run and pass by the impressive young Brora full- back John Pickles. A few minutes later that man MacConnachie made another great save, tipping over the bar Martin MacLean’s goal bound header from a right-wing cross.

In the 65th minute, Lossiemouth won their first corner and this was followed by their first shot on target but it was straight a Joe Malin and didn’t trouble him. This was as a result of the foraging and chasing of the lone Lossie striker Ross Archibald who was substituted for Euan Mellis a couple of minutes later having run himself into the ground. The fact that the Coasters has so little possession – not much more than 10% - made Archibald’s task particularly thankless but he never stopped running and chasing.  

Lossie then took off winger turned-full back William Mathers and replaced him with Scott Gordon and shortly after Brora’s Ally MacDonald was yellow-carded for a foul the Cattachs brought on Colin MacLean –recalled from his loan spell at Clach – for the last 12 minutes in place of Steven MacKay. 

Zander Sutherland went close on 80 minutes when he ran from the left to the right hand side across  edgeof the box and his effort just missed the near post. Lossie then made their 3rd change, bringing on Anthony Ross for Conner MacCauley.

Although they had stuck rigidly to their 4-5-1 game plan for 83 minutes Lossie decided to play the last 7 minutes with 3 at the back, pulling midfielder Ryan Farquhar into the back and pushing their 2 big boys at the back up in search of a goal. However, the only ‘goal’ in the closing minutes  was Martin MacLean’s 85th minute effort which was given offside, the second Brora effort chalked off – the first being for a dubious push in the box. Brora gave run-outs in the last few minutes to Stuart Kettlewell for Scott Houston – who seemed to have twanged his hamstring so probably precautionary – and Lewis Grant for Ally MacDonald.

Richie Brittain was pleased. ‘Another three points and 2 clean sheets. I said to the boys it was all about mental strength today and they all played well’’
