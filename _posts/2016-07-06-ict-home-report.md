Richie Foran who was taking charge of Inverness Caley Thistle for the first time last night, paid Brora Rangers great praise after the sides played out a 1-1 draw in front of a good crowd at Dudgeon Park. 

Speaking after the match Ritchie praised their Highland League opponents as having "a very useful side, who look set for a great season". He also remarked just how well the playing surface looked and upon the general set up of the club. He looked forward to working closely with the club as the season progresses with any development opportunities. 

Inverness took the opportunity to fully utilise their 22 man travelling squad. The first 45 minutes saw a mix of new signings and squad players, whilst the second half saw what will probably be their first eleven take the field. 

Brora Rangers depleted by injury and unavailability, fielded a number of trialists and Ally Macleod was in charge in the dugout. 

Despite it being a preseason friendly, the match was played in a competitive manner and the SPL team got a stern examination from the Cattachs. Messrs Pickles, Ross, Maclean and Gillespie were outstanding, but everybody gave 100% commitment to the cause, and Joe Malin showed exactly why he is such as prized asset. 

Brora took the lead after 56 minutes, when Craig Campbell poked home, whilst Polworth netted for ICT with just 2 minutes of the match remaining. 

Next up for Brora is a fixture against Ross County on Tuesday evening at Dingwall. Again it is a testimony to the regard that Brora Rangers are held that another SPL club want to look at their first team squad as they prepare for their season in the top flight.
