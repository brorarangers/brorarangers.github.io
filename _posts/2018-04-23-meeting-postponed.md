Our scheduled meeting to be held in the Social Club on Tuesday evening has been postponed.

Given the importance of having as many interested parties present at a discussion regarding the running of the Social Club, and the amount of people who we find have previous engagements, the meeting will now go ahead next month on a date yet to be confirmed.

Meanwhile, we have 3 remaining League fixtures to take care of, starting with a trip to Rothes on Wednesday evening.
