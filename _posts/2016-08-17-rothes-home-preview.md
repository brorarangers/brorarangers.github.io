Rothes Football Club last came calling to [Dudgeon Park last August](/2015/08/04/rothes-home-report.html) and were subjected to a devastating display of fast, inventive football from a Cattach squad no doubt encouraged by the raising of the League Champion's flag prior to kick off that day.

On the pitch it was to prove to be an *annus horribilis* for the Speyside club. As is so often the case in the competitive Highland Football League though, it would appear hard work, determination and the pride of a community in their Club is set to consign last season's league campaign firmly in the past.

This season Rothes arrive at Dudgeon Park on the back of a 2-2 draw with Inverurie Loco Works. Goals from Ricky Henderson and Ryan Stuart ensured the points were shared between the two 'Shire teams.

Brora Rangers will be glad to return to a home game after two defeats on the road, and after last night's performance against League 1 side Peterhead confidence deserves to be high. Any early season rustiness appears to be well and truly shaken off and the lads will be keen to get back to winning ways as Grant and his management and coaching team plan the route to our 3rd League Championship.

The youngsters of Sutherland returned to school this week after a wet and windy summer holiday, so we're obviously confident of sunshine and blue skies for this game. Rothes can be guaranteed to bring a happy and noisy gang of supporters along, so get the sun cream and short sleeved shirts looked out and we'll see you at Dudgeon Park for a 3pm kick-off.
