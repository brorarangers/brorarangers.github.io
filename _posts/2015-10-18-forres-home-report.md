Brora Rangers rich vein of form continued when they handed out six of the best to a Forres Mechanics side that arrived at Dudgeon Park on the back of 5 straight wins themselves.

This was a performance of the greatest magnitude and must give Brora a great deal of confidence as they prepare for their second round cup tie against SPFL side Arbroath.

Brora were quick out of the starting stalls and pinned Forres back into their own half from the outset. Early efforts from Sutherland and Greig were only narrowly wide whilst the Forres keeper saved well from a Brindle effort.

It took Brora just 7 minutes to break the deadlock when Martin Maclean was very quick to snap up a spill by the Forres keeper.

The advantage was doubled in 14 minutes when Scott Graham rose beautifully to head in Sutherlands cross.

Brora by this time were totally dominant and Dale Gillespie added a third with a 25 yard power bolt which was unstoppable.

Paul Brindle,a constant thorn in the side of the Forres back line,added a fourth before the break with a sharp finish.

The second half delivered a more consolidating performance by Brora which saw them pepper the Forres goal with numerous efforts which they failed to convert. Both Brindle and Sutherland had goals chalked off for offsides before they both managed to convert wonderful individual efforts to complete the six of the best.

Forres did not play badly, but we're not given a chance to settle by a Brora side that worked especially hard throughout the afternoon.
