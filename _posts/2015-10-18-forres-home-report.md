Brora Rangers rich vein of form continued when they handed out six of the best to a Forres Mechanics side that arrived at Dudgeon Park on the back of 5 straight wins themselves. 

This was a performance of the greatest magnitude and must give Brora a great deal of confidence as they prepare for their second round cup tie against SPFL side Arbroath. 

Speaking after the match, Brora player manager could not hide his delight at the performance. "Everything we did, we did with intent and purpose, there was a great intensity to our play." He was especially pleased with the way his side took control of the game early, describing the first 45 minutes as "phenomenal". 


Brora were quick out of the starting stalls and pinned Forres back into their own half from the outset. Early efforts from Sutherland and Greig were only narrowly wide whilst the Forres keeper saved well from a Brindle effort. 

It took Brora just 5 minutes to break the deadlock when Paul Brindle was very quick to snap up a spill by the Forres keeper who failed to deal with Scott Graham's shot. 

The advantage was doubled in 11 minutes when Scott Graham rose beautifully at the far post to head in Sutherland's pin point cross. 

Brora by this time were totally dominant and Dale Gillespie added a third with a 25 yard power bolt which was unstoppable. 

Paul Brindle, a constant thorn in the side of the Forres back line, added a fourth before the break with a sharp finish again after good work from Sutherland and Greig.

The second half delivered a more consolidating performance by Brora which saw them pepper the Forres goal with numerous efforts which they failed to convert. At the other end of the park, Brora keeper Malin had little to keep him occupied, but did save well from ex Cattach Liam Baxter's long range effort. 

Forres battled well and again Baxter was denied as his lobbed effort was cleared off the line by the head of Grant Munro. 

Both Brindle and Sutherland had goals chalked off for offside before they both managed to convert wonderful individual efforts to complete the six of the best. 

Sutherland's goal was especially deserved as the stand in Captain worked  tirelessly and unselfishly throughout the afternoon, and led his team from the front. 

Paul Brindle completed his hat-trick late into injury time with a fine finish after some neat footwork. 

Forres Manager Russell McFee thought his team did not play badly, but we're not given a chance to settle by a Brora side that worked especially hard throughout the afternoon. 

This coming Saturday Brora play host to Arbroath in the second round of the William Hill Scottish Cup. Board member William Powrie said that the  club were looking forward to welcoming their SPFL opposition and hoped that like last season can progress forward in the competition. "Financially cup runs are important to clubs and the supporters alike.We enjoyed our cup run last season and I'm sure the players will be keen to emulate this again".
