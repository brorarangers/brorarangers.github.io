An extra-time goal from Brora forward Craig Campbell saw the Highland League side finally come out on top in a highly competitive Irn Bru Cup tie at Global Energy Stadium on Tuesday night.

County’s youngsters started well and Brora defender Scott Houston was forced to make a desperate goal-line clearance from a Ross MacIver effort following a corner kick.

At the other end Andrew Greig came close to giving Brora the lead but he blasted his shot wide of target after County keeper Ross Munro failed to hold an Alan Pollock cross.

Munro’s opposite number, Joe Malin pulled off a fantastic save in the 13th minute when managed to get a hand to a stinging shot from Greg Morrison.

The Sutherland side should have taken the lead four minutes later when a Gavin Morrison free kick was helped on by Craig Campbell but Martin MacLean failed to get enough power on his header to beat Munro from close range.

But Brora did go ahead in the 33rd minute when Campbell played the ball into the path of Pollock who drilled a low shot into the corner of the net.

The last action of an evenly contested first period was a whipped in shot from Davis Kellor-Dunn who forced a finger-tip save from Malin.

Brora had a chance to double their lead in the 51st minute when a defence spitting pass from Ally MacDonald picked out Campbell but he pulled his shot wide of target.
But County were back on level terms within a minute when Reghan Tumilty raced down the right flank and crossed to the back post for Greg Morrison to head powerfully beyond Malin.

A double substitution by Brora saw Zander Sutherland and Dale Gillespie replace Pollock and Greig.
The subs made an immediate impact, and Gillespie latching on to a Sutherland pass only for County defender Sam Morrison to make a timely tackle in front of goal.
Greg Morrison, who proved a constant threat throughout, was unlucky with a shot which rebounded off the upright.
But the young County team were not to be denied and a Morrison cut back was swept low into the net by James Wallace in the 76th minute.
However, Brora were back on level terms four minutes laterwhen a Sutherland cross was headed home by Steven MacKay.   

County had a chance to win it in regulation time but MacIver’s goalbound shot was brilliantly turned onto the post and behind by Malin.

Brora gained the upper hand in extra-time and the winner arrived the 103rd minute. Gavin Morrison found Campbell in space in the box and the former County favourite fired a low shot in at the near post.
