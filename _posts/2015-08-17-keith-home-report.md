Keith gave Brora Rangers their stiffest league test yet and it took a while for the champions to impose their usual level of authority on the match.


Keith manager Gordon Winton said that although he was disappointed not to get anything from the game he was pleased by the team’s performance and effort. Ritchie Brittain commented, ‘In the first half we were not at the levels I expected and I told them so at half time. We did improve in the second half and made a lot of chances.’

Keith had won their 2 opening Highland League matches and their only reverse before this game was the 3-0 away defeat to Brora Rangers next opponents Cove Rangers who finished strongly last season and should certainly be one of the main Championship contenders during the current campaign. 

The Maroons started brightly and went ahead early in the game with a 7th minute well-taken goal from Bruce Milne who collected a through ball and tucked it low into the left hand corner of Joe Malin’s goal.

Although Keith were playing with one striker their runners from midfield were getting up quickly to support him and 5 minutes after the goal another Keith attack saw 3 players threatening in the box before Brora’s first fluid move on the quarter hour mark. The resulting corner saw Zander Sutherland’s inviting ball into the box evade everybody. But Keith continued to counter-attack at pace and with menace and after the offside flag ended a move where 2 were clear in the box a good shot by Kris Duncan was well held by Joe Malin to prevent the Maroons going further ahead on 20 minutes.

But at this point Brora now showed a quality they hadn’t been required to show thus far this season – resilience. They dug in and slowly reasserted a dominance of possession without carving out any clear chances before a slick, incisive move that saw the ball move at pace from Paul Brindle to Steven MacKay and his shot could well have resulted in the equaliser but for Keith’s custodian Daniel Bell – a former Brora keeper – reacting swiftly and saving with his feet. Brora now had the bit between their teeth with 70% of possession meaning chances were coming more regularly and when the equaliser finally arrived, it was well worth waiting for. When a cross from the right was cleared to Andrew Greig, he instantly lashed the ball back across goal and into the opposite corner of the net. Greig, who has started the season in tremendous form, almost had a second goal soon after with another drive that just shaved the Keith crossbar.

Keith’s defence was now at full stretch to cope with Brora’s style of fast, direct and positive possession on both flanks as well as through the middle.  Keith keeper Bell again distinguished himself with a great save from a rasping 10 yard shot on the turn from Steven MacKay. And if Andrew Greig’s equaliser showed controlled power and panache his and Brora’s second goal on 38 minutes must be an early contender for goal of the season. He picked up the ball in midfield and instantly sent a 30 yard volley into the roof of the net. There was stunned silence around the ground for a second as the crowd took in the quality of the strike.

Brora were now rampant and shortly before half time a surging run down the left channel by Paul Brindle was ended when he was sent sprawling in the box. The referee waved play on and he must have been the only person in the ground who didn’t think it was a clear-cut penalty. The pace of Brindle’s run meant that the tackling defender was the last man so it would have been a red card. Perhaps the referee’s discretion was the better part of valour in this case! As Ritchie Brittain asked, ‘Why would he go down in that position?’ 

As with the first half, Keith pressed at the start of the second half and almost equalised but for a good save by Joe Malin at the expense of a corner which was cleared. Brora broke at pace to the other end and the irrepressible Greig unselfishly tried to tee up Steven MacKay for a header well held by Daniel Bell. Keith’s Stewart Hutcheon was booked for trying to bring down the Brora wide man during his run and cross.

Shortly afterwards Paul Brindle tried to walk the ball into the net and Daniel Bell blocked Zander Sutherland’s shot in a one-on-one. A few minutes later a slick Brora free kick routine saw the ball move from Zander Sutherland to Gavin Morrison to Colin Williamson with Bell bringing off a great save from Williamson’s far post header as Brora continued to carve out chances.

On the hour, Brora brought on Scott Graham for Paul Brindle and a couple of minutes later Brora centre back Scott Houston’s marauding right wing run was unceremoniously brought to a shuddering halt by Keith full back Greg Smith who was rightly yellow-carded. There was quite a long break in play as Houston received treatment. He limped on for a few minutes before he had to be substituted and replaced by Brora player-coach Stuart Kettlewell. In those few minutes, Keith’s Bruce Milne was booked for a challenge in midfield, their winger Stuart Massie was replaced by Richard Henderson and Scott Whelan had a low snap shot from 25 yards held by Joe Malin. Keith were still trying to break in numbers wherever they could and striker Michael Ewan missed by a whisker after Scott Graham carelessly gave the ball away with a loose pass on the edge of the Brora box.

After Andrew Greig’s excellent strikes in the first half, it was now time for Brora’s other wide man Zander Sutherland to show his lethal qualities. On 75 minutes he finished with aplomb to put Brora 3-1 up after a slick build up featuring Scott Graham and Steven MacKay. Another slick one-touch Brora move on 82 minutes was finished off by Steven MacKay but his joy was short-lived when he saw the offside flag raised. Undaunted by the disallowed goal, Brora continued attacking and Zander Sutherland went close with a solo run and cross-shot held by keeper Bell, and followed this with a run and shot that the Keith stopper parried away to safety. But Sutherland was not to be denied and in the 87th minute he set off on a great right wing run, cut inside past 2 defenders and buried a screamer of a drive inside the helpless Daniel Bell’s left hand post for Brora’s fourth goal. This was the second Brora goal of the day that is a serious contender for goal of the season!

In added time, a great, raking cross-field ball from Dale Gillespie was controlled by Zander Sutherland and his cross-shot was well held at the near post by keeper Bell and, in the last meaningful act of the match, he sprawled to push a Scott Graham shot wide.

For the first quarter of this match, Keith were the better side and it was far from an easy task for Brora to wrest the initiative from them, particularly after Keith went ahead. As manager Gordon Winton told me, ‘I was pleased by our performance and effort. We competed well, and supported our striker well from midfield. We knew what to expect coming to Brora but we were beaten by tremendous strikes from both wingers. If we put in that kind of performance we won’t get beaten 4-1 every week.’

Brora had to fight for the right to play their fast, direct possession football and were put on the back foot by Keith’s lively start and positive attacking intent. Ritchie Brittain said, ‘Keith dominated the first 20 minutes and made it difficult for us and I take my hat off to them. At times we need to be more clinical and braver in possession. We needed to improve and in the second half they did and created lots of chances’
