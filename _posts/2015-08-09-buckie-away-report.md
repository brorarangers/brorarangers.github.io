Brora maintained their excellent 100% start to the season with a comprehensive victory over Buckie Thistle at Victoria Park Buckie on Saturday. The Cattachs ran out 1-8 winners and signalled to all that they are in no mood to relinquish their Press & Journal Highland League crown. 

On a beautiful summers day, it was Buckie who started the brighter and the Brora defence came under immediate pressure, with both Munro and Houston being called upon to block goal bound shots. 

As the half progressed Brora gradually became more dominant and had several good chances before Zander Sutherland put them ahead in 24 minutes from the penalty spot,after Andrew Grieg was bundled to the ground by a clumsy challenge from the Buckie defender.

 The goal seem to relax Brora and they began to play some delightful football and a second was added soon after when Steven Mackay headed home from an Andrew Grieg corner. 

Brora reverted to a more direct approach from the off in this game with long balls from Gillespie, Munro and Morrison causing the Buckie back line no end of problems and it was no surprise when three more were added from Sutherland, Mackay and the workmanlike Brindle before the half time interval.

Brora made it 6 -0 early in the second half with perhaps their best goal of the game. Man of the match, Andrew Greig made another wonderful jinking run down the left flank leaving the defender all at sea, and crossed in the perfect ball. A dummy by Paul Brindle wrong footed the Buckie back line and Zander Sutherland was there to secure his hat-trick with the sweetest of strikes past the hapless keeper at his old stomping ground. 

Despite the scoreline Buckie never gave up and pulled a goal back with a strike worthy of winning any game. A mistake by Williamson at the back saw him dispossessed by Paul Napier who fired home from 25 yards,an unstoppable drive giving Joe Malin between the Brora sticks no chance whatsoever.

The Buckie goal signalled the changes for Brora, with Ally MacDonald and Martin Maclean replacing the reliable Lewis Grant and the hard working Paul Brindle. 

Brora played the remainder of the game out, knowing all three points were safely secured, but Steven Mackay still had time to score a further brace with a lovely header from a Morrison cross and a simple conversion, making it 4 on the day and 9 in the last two games for the leagues most prolific striker. 

Three games into the season, a mood of optimism prevails around Dudgeon Park, but greater challenges lay ahead. However Brora will need to iron out some uncharacteristic sloppy defending which nearly cost them dear early in game and other opponents may be quicker to take advantage off.
