Brora Rangers took a further and crucial step towards a third Highland League title, and at the same time extinguished any lingering ambitions Turriff might of had, with a hard working 3-1 defeat of the Aberdeenshire side at the Haughs on Saturday. 

On a very heavy pitch, following the extensive recent flooding, Brora adapted to the difficult conditions better, and were always the superior side, although a hard working Turriff never made life easy and themselves created several good chances. 

Brora started the brighter and soon were pushing Turriff back into their own half, and Paul Brindle had an early chance which was saved by Kevin Main in the Turriff goal. Main again was called into action after 13 minutes when he saved well from a typical Gavin Morrison drive from all of 25 yards. 

Brora kept the early pressure on Turriff and the breakthrough was well deserved. It was that  man Brindle again who was at the far post to convert the cross from Zander Sutherland who was becoming a thorn in the blues defence. 

Falling a goal behind seemed to galvanise Turriff and they pressed forward with more purpose and both Allan and Nowosielski went close. 

Despite the game flowing from end to end there was no further scoring and Brora were content to take their one goal advantage into the half time break. 

The second period started in up tempo fashion and again it was Brora that were the more determined, and Kevin Main saved well from Paul Brindle. After 55 minutes Zander Sutherland rattled the Turriff bar with 20 yard curling shot with the keeper beaten. 

The near miss spurred Turriff on, and there followed their best period of the match as they sought an equaliser. James Crighton should have perhaps found the target and not the side netting and it was only a brave save from Joe Malin, diving at the feet of Craig MacAskill, that prevented the Turriff forward levelling the score. 

Grant Munro, who was having a great game, very nearly doubled the Cattachs lead with a powerful header, but this time it was Kevin Main that brought off a great save.

Brora did however double their advantage after 73 minutes when Paul Brindle netted his second. This was a superb goal as Brindle timed to perfection his run from inside his own half, and slotted the ball past a stranded Main from the edge of the penalty box. 

With just a dozen minutes remaining, there was still to be plenty of further action, and Turriff were awarded a very soft looking penalty as the referee adjudged Martin Maclean to have tugged at Jamie Beagrie. Astjoms Kuznecovs planted the penalty out of the reach of Joe Malin to ensure that there was to be plenty of life left in the match. 

Brora did not sit on their single goal advantage but pushed forward to kill the game off, and their positive attitude was rewarded, when big Grant Munro was on hand to turn the ball home and endured the Reds returned north with all 3 points. 

Post match Richard Brittain played tribute to all his players attitude and commitment. He was most impressed with Brindle's composure and finishing and that he and Zander Sutherland really hurt the Turriff defence. Brittain and Brora club Chairman John Young also paid tribute to everybody at Turriff who worked so hard in preparing the pitch and the ground, after the devastating effects of the recent floods. 

This win leaves Brora Rangers 9 points clear at the head of the table, and whilst the two chasers Cove Rangers and Formartine United have 3 games in hand, never has there been a better time to have points on the board. Brora also enjoy a far superior goal advantage and have wrestled their destiny back into  their own hands.
