Following on from our IRN-BRU Cup victory over Ross County U20s at the start of the month, arrangements have now been finalised for our trip to Peterhead.

The game will go ahead on **Tuesday 16th August** with a 7:45 kick-off. Tickets are £12.00 for adults with £6.00 Concessions. Under 12s go free if accompanied by an adult.

Peterhead FC have advised that this game is to be ticket only at the turnstiles and supporters are requested to arrive in plenty of time to purchase their tickets from the Ticket Office directly outside the main entrance.

The Blue Toon have featured in our articles before, in a short piece about our [Scottish Qualifying Cup victory](/2016/04/04/the-final-countdown.html) ... and this time it is our turn to attempt to exact some revenge for a Highland League Cup defeat at the start of the 80s.

It's a big game early in the season for us, but we've a trip to Inverurie to concentrate on first. A victory over Cove Rangers on Saturday could see the squad heading east again on Tuesday evening brimming with confidence.
