Well, the current Press & Journal Highland League has now drawn to its conclusion and championship honours go to Buckie Thistle who pipped current flag holders Cove Rangers on goal difference, and ourselves by one point.

My mail box has been well populated since Thursday evening with fans' concerns around the controversy and well aired issues on Buckie Thistle and Formartine United naming allegedly ineligible players.

Given we owe a duty of open communication to supporters, sponsors and club beneficiaries we append below some general clarifications and Brora Rangers position on the matter.

The LMC is made up of one voting representative from each club. It is important to be aware that as a potential beneficiary of a Buckie punishment our LMC representative, David Dowling was precluded from the debate and vote, as was our Board Member Dennis Bridgeford who is of course the President of the Highland League. Indeed the pair of them spent the evening in another room.

After receiving submissions from both sides the acting LMC Chair of the meeting, issued the following statement.

***"The matter in hand was given thorough consideration including hearing submissions from Buckie and Formartine. It was decided to take no further action. In addition, the Secretary of the SHFL was instructed to develop reworded drafts towards clarifying the terms of the rule for application in future seasons."***

Whilst we were most disappointed at this outcome (It certainly makes our expulsion from the Highland League Cup in 2014 look incredibly harsh) we as a club recognise and support the LMC in their wish to produce a clear and unambiguous set of rules to avoid such deeply damaging events in the future. In Dennis Bridgeford at the helm our confidence is fully justified.

We as a club offer Buckie Thistle our unreserved congratulations on their achievements and wish them every success against East Kilbride in the playoffs and then hopefully against team 42 for the prize of promotion into the SPFL.

Our attentions must now turn to our unfinished business in the North of Scotland Football Association Cup and our tie against Nairn next Saturday.

We will all have our views where we lost the league, but the narrowness of the final table shows you just how very competitive our league is where literally every goal is crucial.

Undoubtedly the leagues reputation has been damaged, but  now is the time to move on, and together look forward to, with all the other Highland League family, making  sure that we enjoy a successful and trouble free 2017/18 season.
