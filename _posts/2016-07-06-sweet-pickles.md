It will come with a great sense of relief to Cattach fans that John Pickles, who had to leave the pitch with a nasty looking knock on Tuesday night, is not seriously injured.

It looked like a case of déjà vu when Pickles limped off late in the game, with a knock akin to that which kept him out for several months, which he sustained against Arbroath last season.

Speaking from his home on Orkney, John was able to reassure fans that whilst it looked and felt a bad one, the knee had improved much overnight and that he is looking forward to the season ahead with *relish*
