Club Chairman William Powrie confirmed that initial discussions have taken place with John Pickles with a view to extending his contract until June 2019

"John is one of the very best right backs in the league and has the attitude of the consummate professional. He of course lives on the Orkney Isles which is not ideal, but his application is undoubted and more importantly he wants to stay with Brora Rangers. Clearly John cannot get across for team training but we are grateful to his local club in letting him train and we have certainly seen the benefits of having him back in the line up over the last two weeks. Not only is he a very good footballer he is a very polite young man and a great ambassador for the club"

"Competition in the back line at Brora has been fierce this year, with nobody guaranteed a starting place. John has had plenty of game time and is viewed as one of the really promising youngsters that Brora are developing. Fellow right back Lewis Grant went on loan to Edinburgh based Spartans earlier in the season and is gaining great experience down there."

Further great news for Brora Rangers is that the Lisle twins, Cameron and Scott, both of whom have a huge future in the game, have agreed to extend their contract until June 2019. The twins are thoroughly enjoying their time with the club and are already making an impact at Dudgeon Park. Indeed it was Scott's 20 yard screamer that secured all 3 points against Turriff on Saturday.
