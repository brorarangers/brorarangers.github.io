Let's turn the clock back a few years. 35 years in fact, to 1981. In football terms, Celtic topped the Premier Division, with Aberdeen snapping at their heels. Kilmarnock finished 2nd to bottom and suffered the subsequent relegation to Division 1, swapping places with a victorious Hibernian. Gordon Strachan was pulling on his boots (and scoring) for the National Squad rather than the manager's jacket, and Peterhead were up against a formidable Rangers side in a Cup Final.

The formidable Brora Rangers, in the Highland League Cup final.

Zip forward to the present day, and Brora Rangers are back at the League Cup final again. This time at the happy hunting ground of Grant Street Park in Inverness, facing two times winners Nairn County. We've been collecting a few trophies ourselves over the years, starting with the Scottish Qualifying Cup and adding the North of Scotland Cup, Inverness Cup and Highland League Championships. But the League Cup has proved somewhat elusive ... so far.

The first Highland League Cup was contested in 1946, with Forres claiming victory that year and on a further 6 subsequent occasions.
