#### Heroes - Local, Highland and National

There's no denying it, League Championships are the main prize. To prove ones ability to claim the top spot over a whole season, to ride out the vagaries of injuries and suspensions, to grind out the vital points when Lady Luck appears to have abandoned you, to keep the momentum of the winning streaks, to prove over a full programme of home and away fixtures that you're the best team in the League. That is the measure of a team.

But Cup games, there is something special about them. One chance to keep progressing, one chance to turn the odds on their head, one chance for glory, one chance to be the local heroes. There is an air of excitement about any Cup game that can't often be replicated in a season of home and away fixtures where points can always be made up or lost. A Cup Final, all or nothing, do or die - who doesn't want to be part of that?

After a [narrow defeat to Peterhead](/2016/04/04/the-final-countdown.html) in the 1980/81 League Cup Final, Brora Rangers fought their way back for a second bite of the cherry the following season. 

We carried on the previous season's good habit of getting a home draw in the opening tie, this time against Inverness Thistle. A very close game saw Brora emerge the victors in a 2-1 victory with goals from Bain and B. MacAskill putting the Cattachs through to the Quarter Final. A Quarter Final at Dudgeon Park, a Quarter Final against arguably the Highland League's largest and most successful Club, Inverness Caledonian. Caley had won the League Cup on 5 occasions and this was a period in our history where both sets of supporters had witnessed some terrific battles between the two teams.

MacFarlane, Allan and Mackay ensured this was a battle not to be forgotten in a hurry as they all ensured their names were inscribed on the scoresheet with only a single reply from Caley. The Semi Final beckoned for the second year running.

Not willing to break a winning formula, the village all had their fingers crossed for yet another home tie. It wasn't to be, and a trip to Buckie's Victoria Park was on the cards. Buckie Thistle had no shortage of heroes that season, and lining up against the Reds in the League Cup Semi Final were [Charlie Duncan](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12610175.Local_Hero__Fraserburgh_manager_Charlie_Duncan_has_lost_none_of_his_hunger_despite_a_quarter_of_a_century_at_the_helm/) - without a doubt a local hero for both Fraserburgh and his spells at Buckie, Peterhead and Inverness Thistle - and the man who is the 'confessed' Highland Hero, [Steve Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Paterson). Here was a battle to equal those of our current road to Grant Street Park this weekend.

The game lived up to all expectations and is reported to have raged from end to end. Brora went in to half time leading by the only goal of the first 45, thanks to Mulholland. Hunter grabbed the equaliser in the second half,and the sides proved to be unseparable for the remainder of the match. Back to Dudgeon Park for the replay, a solitary goal from Brora's Bain, and we were back in the League Cup final for the second successive year.

September 2nd, Victoria Park, Dingwall. Facing the last of the Inverness clubs, Clachnacuddin. In common with Nairn County, The Lilywhites had already etched their name on the trophy on two previous occasions, though not since 1951. We'd taken the North of Scotland Cup from their trophy cabinet and here was a chance to get our hands on another.

Suttar, Mulholland, Allan, Duffy, Norris, D. MacAskill, B. MacAskill, Bain, MacFarlane, Hamilton and Mackay took to the park for the final. If confirmation was needed that Highland Heroes took to the park that day, half of our inaugural [Hall of Fame inductees](/2016/02/23/hall-of-fame-inductees.html) pulled on the Brora Rangers shirt that afternoon. It was an enthralling match, with neither side giving an inch. Full time saw the scores locked at 1-1, extra time was nail biting, when Clach's young forward scored his second, and ultimately the winning goal to leave the Sutherland team disappointed yet again. Given that the young forward would go on to score for Chelsea, Aberdeen, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Scotland, it took a National hero of the stature of [Duncan Shearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Shearer) to prevent us from claiming the League Cup last time round.

The Brora Rangers teams of the late 70s and early 80s were arguably the best until very recent times. The majority of this season's squad have picked up four trophies in their fantastic last two seasons. Saturday sees us with the opportunity to claim a fifth. Five trophies in three seasons. If the squad that fought so hard in our last League Cup final produced three inaugural members in our Hall of Fame, which of our current squad could find their names immortalised on the list in coming years? It may be easier to ask which of them couldn't.
