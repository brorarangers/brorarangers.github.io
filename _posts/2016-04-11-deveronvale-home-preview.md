It's the last day of the 2015/16 Press & Journal Highland Football League for Brora Rangers on Saturday. That is always a bittersweet occasion. It has been a long, hard season. The squad have certainly earned a break, those working behind the scenes will be grateful of the chance to draw breath, those who have followed the Club from Fort William to Wick and from Fraserburgh to Inverness, can resume weekends outside football. But we'll miss it.

In the process of winning the Highland League Cup on Saturday for the first time in our history, we lost our spot at the top of the League table for the first time since November. We knew it was coming, and realistically we are now in a fight to claim second place where goal difference can be the deciding factor depending on results at Station Park and Seafield Park.

Deveronvale haven't chalked up a win since the 20th February in a 3-0 home win over Rothes. That won't stop Steve Dolan and his team looking to monopolise on a chance to meet a Brora squad who have been playing an awful lot of extra time football in the previous weeks.

Dale Gillespie, so often the goal hero for ourselves this season, and Steven Mackay were the scorers in our last meeting with Deveronvale. That was Steven's 13th goal of the season, in his 11th start of 2015/16, on his way to scoring his 150th goal for Brora Rangers against Forres Mechanics last week.

It's interesting to see how both clubs viewed our last meeting. Deveronvale, with fresh memories of beating both Wick Academy and Rothes away from home the previous month reported - 

*"First half strikes from Dale Gillespie and Steven Mackay were enough for champions Brora Rangers to take the three points back to Sutherland and keep the defence of their title alive in this rather dull affair which failed to spark into life for the small band of respective supporters who were left hoping for a decent firework display later in the evening to make up for the lack of entertainment on show at PRP."*

Whereas ourselves, on our march back from the early defeats to Cove Rangers and Formartine Utd, seemed a bit more upbeat - 

*"Player Manager Richard Brittain was delighted with the outcome and commented, 'From the moment we set foot on the pitch for the warm-up our attitude was spot on. We worked very hard at training during the week and everybody knew exactly what was expected of them.'*

*'We set out to use the full width of the pitch and that was shown in our second goal, one of the best you will see anywhere. Our range of passing and composure on the ball was excellent with both our full backs, Ally MacDonald and John Pickles giving us additional wide attacking options'"*

We've spent the season focusing on our own games, but on Wednesday night we can only be spectators whilst Cove Rangers meet Clachnacuddin at Grant Street Park and Formartine Utd travel to Nairn. A solitary point will clinch the League for Cove. Formartine probably have the tougher test against a Nairn County side that we know only too well can provide stiff opposition.

Regardless of the result of the Wednesday night games, regardless of the outcome of our final home fixture, Saturday will be a day of celebration at Dudgeon Park with our end of season award winners being announced. That's another news article to come, to postpone our end of season blues for another week.

**It's the last chance for Highland League action at Dudgeon Park on Saturday though - try not to miss it.**
