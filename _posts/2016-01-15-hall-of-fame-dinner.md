Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the launch of a Hall of Fame to recognise the contribution of the many who have helped to make Brora the great club it is.

The inaugural event will be a dinner in the Social Club on the 19th February 2016, where the names of the first 6 people will be announced by former Scotland manager Craig Brown.

Candidates are being selected from past players, officials, committee members, staff, helpers, long standing supporters and in fact anyone who has made a significant contribution the the club.

The cost of tickets has been restricted to only Â£40 to encourage as many people as possible to attend. Availability is limited to the space though, so don't delay and book now to avoid disappointment. Tables of six, eight and ten are available as well as for individuals. Names can be registered through the Social Club, Supporters Club or through our Secretary, [Kevin Mackay](mailto:brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com).
