It's back to League business on Wednesday 16th March as we welcome Fort William FC to Dudgeon Park. 

Whilst it hardly feels like it's been an exceptionally bad winter, the weather has certainly conspired to be be on it's worst behaviour in an almost perfect rhythm with the Highland League fixture list since the start of the year.

| | Played | GD | Points |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Brora Rangers|26|81|67|
|Cove Rangers|25|46|64|
|Formartine Utd|24|78|60|

So that leaves us with 8 League games to complete in time for the scheduled Highland League / Lowland League Pyramid Playoff games. Cove need to find room for an extra game and Formartine will have to squeeze in yet an additional fixture. The first leg of the Highland League Champions v Lowland League Champions is set for 23rd of April.

The remaining League fixtures will be announced following the outcome of this weekend's Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup semi finals. 

As of today, though, here's what we know ...

There are some season defining matches in amongst that list. It's the final run in for the hopeful 2015/16 Highland League Champions, and either ourselves or Cove will be looking at a Highland League Cup Final game to fit in somewhere too. No doubt about it, if Mother Nature plays her part the games will be coming thick and fast over the next few weeks. 

**Get your diaries at the ready, polite excuses planned, time off booked, Wedding Anniversaries postponed, Birthday celebrations cancelled and the Wednesday night Pot Noodle dinners organised. It's going to be an exciting finish to the season, and we don't want you to miss being a part of it.**
