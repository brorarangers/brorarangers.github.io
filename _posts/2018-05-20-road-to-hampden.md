The William Hill Scottish Cup was pretty special for a few Scottish Highland Football League members this season.

It was a journey that started on the 23rd September 2017 for us, and our only home game of the tournament. With Girvan FC safely dealt with it then became a road trip to Edinburgh, to record another 5 goal victory over City Service Strollers, League 1 Stranraer, League 1 East Fife and finally, Premiership hot property Kilmarnock.

Killie killed our dream with a pretty clinical second half display which was typical of the way they had been dealing with the rest of Scotland's top flight teams over the preceeding weeks.

However, it was a fantastic journey and we made many, many new friends along the way. The lads pulled out some amazing performances against higher league opposition, so it was especially pleasing to see Steven and the squad featured on the big screen at Hampden ahead of the Cup Final on Saturday afternoon.

Original Moments, Unforgettable Memories.
