The Challenge Cup was instigated in 1990/1 to mark the Centenary of the Scottish Football League.

The proposals for the new format for  next season are as follows;

The competition will be made up of the following;

  - *30 Teams from the Championship, League 1 and League 2*
  - *4 Teams from the Highland League*
  - *4 Teams from the Lowland League*
  - *2 Teams from the Northern Ireland League*
  - *2 Teams from the Welsh Premier League*
  - *12 under 20 teams from the Scottish Premiership.*

This is a very exciting format and whilst we were knocked out 1-0 to Alloa Athletic in this season's competition the new proposed format does offer the possibility of some very interesting ties - Now where exactly is Bala Town and Crusaders FC ?

Turning to matters nearer home, there has been a lot of press and media speculation around the future structure of Highland League football.

Regardless of the club's ambitions to progress onward, Brora Rangers are committed to a strong and vibrant Highland League, regardless of any divisional changes there may or may not be. There is a meeting on Thursday evening of all league clubs to discuss the current set up and evaluate any possible changes. Brora Rangers will play their full part at this meeting.
