We had the pleasure of hosting the draw for the Quarter Finals of the Breddon Aggregates Highland League Cup on Saturday afternoon.

Alan Mackenzie, Chief Executive of Breedon's Northern Operations, ably assisted by Dennis Bridgeford, pulled the following ties out of the bag.

- Deveronvale or Nairn County v Turriff United
- Rothes or Formartine United v Clachnacuddin or Fort William
- Huntly v Brora Rangers
- Forres Mechanics v Cove Rangers

Rothes will play Formartine Utd, and Clachnacuddin will play Fort William on Wednesday 15th February, whilst we will need to wait until Saturday 18th for the outcome of the game between Deveronvale and Nairn County.

The Quarter Finals will take place on Saturday 25th February.
