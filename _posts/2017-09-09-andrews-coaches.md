It was with regret that the club learned that Andrews Coaches (Shetland) Ltd have ceased training.

From their depot in Rogart they served the club well and produced for us a stunning coach which attracted so much welcome attention.

We wish all employees the very best, in such a difficult situation.

We are delighted that our friends from D&E Coaches in Inverness have driven to our rescue and will take over our transport requirements going forward.
