Ross Tokely hasn't let the poor weather stand in the way of progress this week.

Alan Pollock will be leaving the Club to join Forres Mechanics, meanwhile Scott Graham will be making the return journey from Mosset Park back to Dudgeon Park.

Kyle Macleod currently with Ross County will also be joining Brora Rangers, initially to the end of this season, but it is hoped a longer deal can be negotiated going forward.
