Brora Rangers were beaten in their final pre-season friendly against Fife outfit, Kelty Hearts 2-0 at Dudgeon Park on Saturday. 

In front of a reasonable crowd including a good travelling support, the Hearts were deserved winners, as they out muscled a somewhat uncharacteristically lethargic Brora.  

The Fifers were a big strong fast side who never allowed Brora to settle and always looked dangerous when they were attacking. Despite its pre-season status, the match was played at a good tempo and both sides would have benefitted greatly from the workout. 

Brora welcomed back Scotty Houston and long term injury case  Gavin Morrison. Paul Brindle, Martin Maclean, Lewis Grant,Callum MacDonald and new signing Alan Pollock were on the bench and central defender Colin Williamson was out with a toe injury. 

Kelty took the lead in the first half with a penalty after Houston brought down the Kelty forward. Dalziel scored his fourth goal in as many games with a great spot strike.  They doubled their advantage after Archie Campbell  danced through 4 Brora defender's and finished with a well positioned drive. 

Brora's man of the match was keeper Joe Malin, who once again pulled off a string of stunning stops, whilst at the other end Mackay, Sutherland, Greig and Gillespie all had good chances which on another day they would have converted. 

Speaking after the match Brora Manager Grant Munro felt that his team were beaten by the better side on the day, but said "it was great preparation for the start of the Highland League campaign"
