Last October Brora Rangers made the mid-week trip to Huntly following an uncomfortable few games. By that stage last season it was obvious we weren't about to rule the Highland League in the same manner we had won our previous League Championships.

A frustrating 0-2 defeat against [Formartine Utd](/2015/09/14/formartine-home-report.html), a scare at [Claggan Park](/2015/09/21/fortwilliam-away-report.html) and a hard earned point at home against [Turriff Utd](/2015/10/05/turriff-home-report.html) preceded our trip to Christie Park.

Conversely, Huntly had recently dealt out a 5-0 win at home against Rothes, suffered a narrow 4-3 defeat at Buckie's Victoria Park, and blasted another 5 goals against Keith at Kynoch Park whilst only conceding 1. 

For an incessantly wet Wednesday night there was a fantastic turnout from the Brora support who were determined to give the squad their backing. It was needed. Our [match report](/2015/10/07/huntly-away-report.html) recalls us dominating the game but failing to capitalise. That was until our diminutive former Highland League Player of the Year clinched a winner in the 88th minute. 

It's a different story this season though. With only one hiccup in our League campaign so far, somewhat nullified by similar stumbles from all those considered Championship challengers apart from an impressively ascendant Buckie Thistle, there is a definite buzz on the streets of Brora. Especially so after our practically faultless display against a Lossie side who had hitherto refused to capitulate to competitors.

As we noted ahead of the Lossie game, it would be foolhardy to take any fixture lightly given the results around the League this season. Huntly are the only other team to take points off Lossie so far this season, and if proof were needed of the danger they pose, and their refusal to give up, a look at their recent 4-4 thriller at Harmsworth Park should do the job.

Equally though, it has been apparent right from our pre-season friendly against Forfar this season, it will  be a reckless side that approach Brora Rangers without due respect. Any lingering doubts about our pretentions to finish this season as Champions once again were firmly laid to rest on Wednesday evening. It wasn't the scoreline that was making the headlines this morning as the good people of the village got about their daily business, it was the manner in which the game was played. 

As our [match report](/2016/09/01/lossie-home-report.html) notes, it's no surprise that Lossiemouth have been flying high this season given the manner in which they played, but for the full 90 minutes the Cattachs certainly laid down a marker for others to mull over.

So, Huntly on Saturday afternoon then. The Supporters bus leaves Dudgeon Park at 10.30 for a 3pm kick off. The Big Red Machine rumbles on. See you there!
