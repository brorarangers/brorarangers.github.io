The Board have announced revised admission charges for the coming season.

 
Admission will now be £9 with concessions at £5. Speaking on behalf of the Board, William Powrie regretted the increase, but stressed that this was bringing us in line with other Highland League Clubs and also reflected the significant overheads in the running of the club.
