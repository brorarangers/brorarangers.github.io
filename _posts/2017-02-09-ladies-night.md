Ladies, we felt it was time that we organised a little bit of pamapering for you. So reserve a space in your diaries for the 31st March.

In a departure from our annual Ladies Day, held at Dudgeon Park as part of the match day experience, this year the format will be a spectacular evening at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness.

It promises to be a fantastic evening with live musical entertainment and special guests along with an exclusive gift bag to take home.

Get in touch with [Dale](mailto:dale_john31@hotmail.com) for more information regarding the evening and the transort from Brora to Inverness and home again on the night.
