It's time for our second visit of the season to Harlaw Park. Last time round wasn't our happiest trip, with Cove Rangers inflicting our [first League defeat](/2015/08/24/cove-away-report.html) since 21st December 2013.

This time we travel to meet Harlaw's residents in a fixture that has rarely failed to provide exiting football over the last few seasons. Originally scheduled to be played on 24th October, rearranged to a long Wednesday night trip on the 28th due to Scottish Cup business, and now moved to this Saturday due to Wick Academy and Nairn County requiring a Scottish Cup 2nd Round replay, there is no reason why this season's fixture should be any different.

The Locos are sitting 6th in the League at present, 8 wins from 14 games, though no points from the teams currently sitting above them, and losses to Wick, Lossiemouth and Huntly.

Our head to head record over the past few seasons shows Brora winning all 3 points, but usually in tight games separated by a single goal. Though this fixture last season saw Brora return home with a very solid 5 goal victory and a clean sheet.

The Locos come into this game buoyed by their progression into the 3rd Round of the Scottish Cup with a win over the Lowland League's Edinburgh University AFC.

The rearrangement of this fixture means the travelling support will miss the start of [Ronnie 'n' Donnie's](/2015/10/19/halloween-dance.html) Halloween gig, but they can take comfort in the fact that the Chuff Chuffs will no doubt do their best to prepare our ears with equally loud, but sadly less tuneful entertainment.

The efforts of our own musicians against Arbroath was greatly appreciated. The Supporters Club are arranging a bus to Inverurie, leaving Dudgeon Park at 9:45am. We'd love to see the pipes and drums backing the team throughout another big fixture for the Club so book your seat through our Supporters Club Facebook page or get in touch through our [email address here](mailto:brorarangers@gmail.com).
