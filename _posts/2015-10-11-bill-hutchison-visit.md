Derby County fan, Bill Hutchison was intrigued by the success of Brora Rangers over the past two years and wanted to see for himself the team in action.

Living just outside of Derby, in Little Eaton, a village the same size as Brora, Bill was astonished how such a small place as Brora could have got to the cusp of gaining entry into the SPFL

Bill made the 1000 round trip at the weekend and was delighted at what he found. Speaking after the game he said "the standard of football was very high and the facilities at the ground a credit to all involved. I would love to come back when they reach the SPFL"

Bill is seen being welcomed to Dudgeon Park by Brora Rangers board member William Powrie.
