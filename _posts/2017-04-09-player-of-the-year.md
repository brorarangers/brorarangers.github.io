Picking a Player of the Year has been an incredibly difficult decision for several season here at Dudgeon Park. This season was no different.

However, there seemed to be general agreement that **Zander Sutherland** was deserving of recognition given that he picked up the **Player of the Year** along with the **Supporters Club Player** of the Year trophies.

The wily winger scored his 100th goal for Brora back in February, 20 of those in this season. Ask him about assists ... we don't keep records of them, but we are pretty sure he has them all noted down.

Picking our **Young Player of the Year** was always going to be problematic this season. With the increasing influence of our younger players in the squad we have a promising future ahead.

Ross Munro has seemed to grow in confidence and stature with every passing game since taking over from Joe Malin as our first choice keeper as Joe recovers from injury; Scott Lisle has greatly impressed all in his 13 appearances this season, scoring 3 goals and putting in some noteworthy perfomances; Kyle Macleod, who only joined us in late January, has become a goal scoring machine ... frequently not content with scoring only the once.

This season though, the honours go to **John Pickles** again, a player who settled so quickly into our defence last season it is easy to forget he is one of our youngsters. Orkney based John was already named in the Press and Journal Team of the Year and recently committed his future to the Club until the end of the 2018-19 season. We imagine there will be a few more awards to come.

The Highland Football League is extremely competitive, every point is a prisoner, and no team can hope to come close to winning it by relying on a couple of 'star' players. It takes teamwork and commitment from the full squad to grind out the wins when the chips are down, Lady Luck has turned her back on you and every bounce of the ball seems to favour the opposition. Whilst it must be pleasing to receive the recognition from your Club and support, recognition from your team-mates for your efforts on and off the pitch is an accolade which speaks volumes for your part in keeping Brora Rangers competing at the top of the League and fighting for Cup victories.

This year that accolade goes to **Ally Macdonald**. A firm favourite with the support for his performances this season, it's great to see Ally named **Players' Player of the Year**.
