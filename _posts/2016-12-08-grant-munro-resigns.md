Grant Munro has resigned from his position of player manager with Brora Rangers with immediate effect.

Club Chairman William Powrie thanked Grant not only for his time as player manager but also beforehand as a team member of the double P&J Highland League title winning side.

"Grant has enjoyed several seasons with Brora Rangers and has been a firm favourite of the fans. The management role brings with it much added pressures and challenges, and Grant felt that progress was not being made as he originally had wished. We wish him every success for the future."

The team for this Saturday away at Rothes will be under the management of current Assistant  Manager Steven MacDonald.
