The end of August sees Lossiemouth come to town. When Lossie last headed over the Kessock Bridge it was to face our northern neighbours, Wick Academy. It was a game that certainly created some talking points, not least the fact that all 3 points returned on the bus to Grant Park.

Fitting in a match on a *'School Night'* can be a headache, but given that The Coasters have already taken full points from their games against Turriff and Wick, Wednesday 31st August promises to be a match well worth watching.

So, how about a Curry Night Hospitality package for the perfect mid-week treat? Go on, you know you deserve it!
