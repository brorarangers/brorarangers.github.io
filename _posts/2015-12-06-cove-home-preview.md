Saturday the 12th December 2015, and all eyes will be on the outcome of the match of the day at Dudgeon Park.

Cove Rangers signalled their intent back at the start of the season when the two teams met at Harlaw Park ([Match report here](/2015/08/24/cove-away-report.html) if you'd forgotten the outcome of that game ...)

We haven't even made it to Christmas yet, there's plenty of action to be had over the coming months, but there is little doubt amongst the Brora support that this is a **big** game.

Brora are currently sitting 3 points clear of Cove Rangers at the top of the table - but Cove currently have 3 games in hand, and a mid-week trip planned to Fort William before the clash at Dudgeon Park. Weather permitting, there will be a fair few raised eyebrows if Saturday's match doesn't see the teams take the pitch on equal points.

Any pre-match trepidation amongst the Brora support appears to be cancelled out by the confidence among the squad. They've strung together a fine winning streak over the last 10 League games, scoring 37 goals on the way and keeping 7 clean sheets.

We can dig into statistics for both sides over several seasons (we probably will to be honest) but none of them really count for much once 3pm comes around on Saturday. The result when the referee signals full time, however, will count for more ... much, much more.

A top of the table clash, with the outcome possibly having huge consequences for both sides come the end of the season isn't a game to miss. The Club would love to see you all paint Dudgeon Park Red and White next weekend and make yourselves the 12th man again. We already have word of one loyal Cattach making a 400 mile round trip to back the Reds ... he has been promised a free pie for his efforts though!
