Say what you want about entertaining football, think what you will about the style in which a game is played.

Every game brings it's own highlights, but when the season is over they tend to blend into the same whole fuzzy memory of great days out with your Club. Unless, of course, the game resulted in a major milestone. The day your Club won the League. The day your day won the Cup. History, as they say, is written by the victors.

For Brora fans, we've had a few of these stand out days. Those 'where were you when ...?' moments. Where were you when Brora overcame Formartine Utd after penalties with a striker in goal? Where were you when we repeated the same nail biting finish against the eventual League Champions? Where were you when Brora finally lifted the Highland League Cup?

Ahhh, memories. They are great. However, more importantly now, where will you be when we start our defence of the Breedon Aggregates League Cup? To be fair, we don't know the answer to that ourselves yet. However, what we do know, is that we will know soon.

The draw for the Preliminary and First rounds of this season's competition will take place at Inverurie Loco Works Harlaw Park on the 21st of November starting at 12 noon.

Whilst we are not advocating taking the day off to await the results of the draw, it will be announced through our Twitter updates for the eager beavers, it should be a date for your diary.
