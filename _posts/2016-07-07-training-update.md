Under the watchful eye of Ally Macleod, the Brora players enjoyed a lighter than normal Thursday training session following their match against Inverness Caley on Tuesday night.

Great to see Zander Sutherland back in full training, although Gavin Morrison was confined to running and exercise duties.

Speaking in a break from his goalkeeping duties, Joe Malin paid tribute to his team mates. "It was hard on the lads facing Forfar and Inverness as our first brace of pre-season friendlies. All credit to them as most of them had to play 90 minutes".

When asked about his knee he acknowledged that he still feels it a little when kicking but it continues to improve and he's looking forward to the start of the season.

Star of the training session was however the ball boy, who spent the evening fielding Brindle's wayward shots to the bemusement of the horses in the field!
