In a bizarre twist of fate , the Press & Journal Highland League flag will be presented to Cove Rangers at their 'home' game against Brora Rangers at Inverurie on Sat 13th of August.

Grant Munro and his management team have cancelled any further invitations for team-talk suggestions ... we don't think we'll need any more motivation on the day than that!
