The Board of Brora Rangers have reluctantly accepted the resignation of Richard Britain as team manager with immediate effect. 

Brittain said that he was "sorry to be stepping down after just one season, but occupational activities and family commitments meant that he could not dedicate the time required to fulfil the heavy preseason activities that were necessary."

Speaking on behalf of the Board, William Powrie paid tribute to Richard's endeavours throughout the season, which delivered a top three finish in the Press & Journal Highland League and saw the club win the Highland League Cup for the first time in the club's history. 

Powrie empathised with the rhetoric behind Brittains decision, citing the time and commitment taken up in his new construction career and the impending birth of their second child due within the next few weeks. 

Brittain added "I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at the club and the experience will be invaluable. I would like to thank the Board and Committee of the club, my staff, the players and all the fans for the support and encouragement which they gave me. I hope to be able to continue as a player with the club"
