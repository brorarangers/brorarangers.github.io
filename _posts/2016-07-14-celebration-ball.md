Following the great success of our previous events, Brora Rangers are delighted to announce that we are holding a Sportsman's Dinner and Celebration Ball at the top venue in Inverness, The Kingsmills Hotel on Friday 2nd September 2016.

The event is open to individuals, couples and groups and there will be an opportunity for dancing the night away to top local band Torridon once the formalities and other entertainment has concluded.

We are delighted to have secured the services of one of the country's top entertainers in Eric Davidson. Eric started performing on the busy after dinner circuit in 2003 and has picked up several awards in appearances across the length and breadth of the UK.

Despite being the hottest ticket in town, we have held the cost to only Â£650.00 + VAT for a table of ten.

So, whether it's a group of guys looking for a great laugh and a good night out, or couples looking for good food, great entertainment and a night's dancing, book now for the premier event of the year in Inverness.
