It's the last day of 2015, and the final episode in the review of our season so far. It's a time for new beginnings, a time for reflection on times past, and for showing resolve regarding times to come. It's a time for celebration. Here's one of ours.

Something special happened there. Few who witnessed it were left in any doubt that they were looking at a group of players who had looked back, and were now looking forward with a hunger and passion that was going to lead to many more similar celebrations. We've witnessed many joyous scenes with our Club; Cup wins, League wins, precious victories against Wick Academy. This one however was a fortunate ricochet into 13th placed Huntly's net. OK, lets go back a bit ...

We left [Part 2](/2015/12/30/hogmanay-review-2.html) of our review at a place where our on field business seemed to have taken a bit of a stumble. 4th in the League and as yet waiting for a win over the other title contenders. We'd seen glimpses of utter brilliance earlier in the season, and felt we had the squad and staff to retain our League Championship, but right now, things weren't going exactly to plan. Our tenacious 1-1 draw with Turriff was closely followed by a mid week 120 mile trek to Christie Park in Huntly.

After an afternoon pitch inspection due to the incessant rain we'd all been suffering from, it was 'Game On' and a sizeable travelling support, given the weather, distance and timing of the game, made their way along the A96. If frustration and anxiety followed by relief and joy are your thing, this was the perfect [match for you](http://brorarangers.football/2015/10/07/huntly-away-report.html). Despite Zander opening the scoring within 7 minutes, Huntly would not lie down. With the clock ticking down and the teams locked at 2-2, it was looking less and less likely that Brora were going to find time for a winner. Until the 88th minute, when Chubbs lashed the ball into a congested Huntly box, off the crossbar, back down and over the line. Cue wild celebrations both on and off the park. The determination shown by the players that night really felt like a turning point.

It was.

The following Saturday saw a [professional display](/2015/10/11/strathspey-home-report.html) against a well organised Strathspey Thistle, 3 goals, 3 points and a clean sheet. The clean sheets were becoming ever more important given just how close things were at the top of the table and Cove's apparent refusal to drop points. Cove had finished the afternoon with a 0-1 away victory over Formartine and we moved up into second place above the Pitmedden Club on goal difference. 

It was time for an [in form Forres](/2015/10/13/forres-home-preview.html) to visit Dudgeon Park, With 6 wins on the trot including a victory over Lossiemouth in the 1st Round in the Scottish Cup and a 6-2 victory over Buckie Thistle the Can Cans must have entered the game with a fair degree of optimism. However, it wasn't to be for Forres as the Big Red Machine smashed six goals passed them with no reply in what was possibly the best [display of the season](/2015/10/18/forres-home-report.html) so far. Perfect preparation for our Scottish Cup tie against Arbroath.

Talking of preparations for the Cup, the following week our website went into overdrive to build up the anticipation of another Cup run ...

Whilst [Part 1](/2015/10/19/arbroath-home-preview-pt1.html) concentrated on Arbroath's current form, [Part 2](/2015/10/20/arbroath-home-preview-pt2.html) was the start of a rather obvious call to action for the Brora support. [Part 3](/2015/10/20/arbroath-home-preview-pt3.html) was a blatant attempt to stir up grudges from the 1956 game against the Lichties, whilst the [4th episode](/2015/10/20/arbroath-home-preview-pt4.html) focused on last season's successful Cup run.

The [final instalment](/2015/10/20/arbroath-home-preview-pt5.html) was the ultimate call to arms, introducing 'Cattach Comejoinus', the Poster Boy of the Brora Support.

And turn up they did. Arbroath brought a bouyant and noisy support with them, but they were no match for the crowds in red and white, armed with pipes and drums. The atmosphere was everything you could want in a big game.

The early loss of the free scoring Paul Brindle in the  first 15 minutes was a set back, and we were unlucky not to get at least a replay from the fast and intense [1-2 defeat](/2015/10/25/arbroath-home-report.html) at the hands of an extremely entertaining opponent. Colin's injury turned out to be a broken cheek bone, a nasty injury that would rule him out for the rest of the year.

*Trigger* was meant to be on Golden Mic duty ...

Popping up at 16:24 for a 15:00 kick off wasn't going to help his chances when the end of season award ceremony rolls around, no matter how many cups of tea he'd had to drink ...

Meanwhile, Nairn County and Wick Academy were playing in a dress rehearsal for their upcoming North of Scotland Cup final. A 2-2 finish meant our League derby scheduled for the following Saturday was postponed, but some quick work from the League Secretary saved us from a mid-week trip through to Inverurie, and the Locos were to be our next step in our title challenge. Time to make some happier [Harlaw Park memories](/2015/10/25/inverurie-away-preview.html).

The game was tight, but a strike from Zander and yet another clean sheet saw us return with 3 points, and just in the mood to party with Ronnie n Donnie to raise some funds for both the Supporters Club and MFRs Cash for Kids appeal.

When we sat down at the start of the season to discuss this website with our resident computer geek, he was a great pains to point out to us that we needed to be dragged into the digital age, he produced a digital strategy tieing up the website, Twitter and Facebook. He spoke about the site being more than just a place to put our Club news and the opportunity to raise the profile of Brora Rangers Football Club as we sought promotion. He sends regular reports on how frequently the site is viewed, by how many people, where the traffic comes from and whether people view the site on mobile phones or sitting at a computer. To be honest we were impressed.

Turns out, he knows nothing. When it comes to sorting out the free transfer list, his name will be at the top. We should have known all along we already had the man to send us viral in the digital world working tirelessly on the pitch. Steven 'Sid' Mackay, Captain Goals, Mr Dependable ... and now, Internet Sensation. Our website chappie got excited when our site received over 700 visits in one day. Steven's video has had, at the very least, 400,000 views.

That's publicity for you ... even [Paul Heaton of The Beautiful South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAsWpNR8IuE) couldn't grab that much attention. (2 minutes 30 if you just want to skip to the important bit)        
        
It's probably better to read our [full match report](/2015/11/09/deveronvale-away-report.html) as there was a bit more to it than a 30 second video suggests. But the upshot was 2 goals, 3 points, and yet another clean sheet.

Now, who springs to mind when you think of fiercely contested derby games? Boca Juniors v River Plate, Red Star Belgrade v FK Partizan, Ajax v Feyenoord, Brora v Wick? OK, which of them were playing on the 11th November ... ahhh. [The North Derby](http://brorarangers.football/2015/11/12/wick-home-report.html) it is, and feelings were still running high regarding the earlier North of Scotland Cup defeat. It really seems to matter little where Wick Academy or ourselves are sitting in the League when we meet, form and statistics go out the window as we each lift our games in the effort to keep the bragging rights on our respective sides of the Ord. 

This game didn't disappoint in any department, not least the 3-1 scoreline, keeping us right on the heels of Cove and extending our unbeaten league run to 8 games. 

![Brora supporters Halloween Bash promised to be a scream]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-6.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Formartine had also lost to Cove back in October in the League, but had held them to a 1-1 draw in the Scottish Cup at the end of November. Fraserburgh had knocked Cove out of the Aberdeenshire Cup, so it was obvious no one was invincible, and we all had everything to play for.

Next up for Brora was Lossie who were having an inconsistent time of it. Our [match report](http://brorarangers.football/2015/11/15/lossie-home-report.html) recorded

*'Lossiemouth’s game plan was to contain and smother – park the bus in front of the goal in Jose Mourinho’s memorable phrase. They played a 4-5-1formation with lone striker Ross Archibald working his socks off tracking back and trying to feed off scraps. This was a surprisingly unambitious formation for a much-improved Lossie side this season who, under Charlie Charlesworth have won almost as many games as they have lost and are now more a mid-table side than down among the also-rans.'*

Park the bus as they might, goals came from a Zander Sutherland assisted O.G. and a Dale Gillespie penalty. Another clean sheet, another step closer.

The match was barely finished when our super-fans were back to work again, the pitch was about to become under extra pressure over the next few weeks, and Sandy wanted it in tip top condition.

![Brora supporters Halloween Bash promised to be a scream]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-7.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

We've mentioned a couple of villains in our roundup. Garry Wood, who killed of our promotion hopes at the end of last season for Montrose and then opened the scoring for his new Club, Formartine Utd, on their way to an early victory over us in September. Booo. Next up in the villains role was John McLeod of Fort William with his stunning hat-trick against us at Claggan Park the following week. Booo ... oh, wait a minute. Turns out he's not such a villain after all. In fact, it turns out he's actually a great chap. Turns out we [signed him](/2015/11/17/john-macleod.html) so he could start scoring for us rather than against us. He did, without any hanging about.

In other news, Cove Rangers were held to a 3-3 draw by Fraserburgh in a Tuesday night game at North Lodge Park. Fraserburgh certainly can pull off the big results to upset title challenges, as we discovered in our past two seasons.

Buckie Thistle were next in the firing line, and a [scoring debut](/2015/11/19/buckie-home-report.html) for our villian turned hero, yet another clean sheet and Brora were now on an 8 game winning streak and had pulled themselves up to the top of the table, albeit on goal difference, and Cove still sitting with two games in hand.

Then it was off to the beleaguered Rothes. While the Speysiders seemed well on the way by now to getting to grips with matters off the field, it was a sair fecht for the lads on the pitch. A solitary point and a goal difference of -85, and about to face the lads that beat them 11-0 at Dudgeon Park. Whilst we hadn't seen any confirmation from official sources, rumour had it on the Brora Rangers Supporters Facebook page that the Club were allowing production companies to use Mackessock Park for filming. 

![Brora supporters well wrapped up against the cold]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-8.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

We believe this rumour may have started due to a mistaken assumption that fans had stumbled across a remake of 'Last of the Summer Wine', however, these three were more likely to have been recruited during Brora's Scarecrow Festival as we reported in [Part 2](/2015/12/30/hogmanay-review-2.html).

Whilst Rothes [held the score](/2015/11/24/rothes-away-report.html) to 4 less than our earlier meeting, the damage was all done in the first half with 7 goals without reply. Teenager Lewis Grant, in his first start for the side, topped a fantastic performance by finding the net twice. It was a dominant display to take the lads into a weekend off due to Buckie Thistle's continued involvement in the Scottish Cup.

We were still busy behind the scenes though, and launched a range of Christmas [Merchandise](/2015/11/28/christmas-merchandise.html) before November was finished.

The first weekend in December and we rolled into Keith's Kynoch Park to face a team which had given us a [stern test](/2015/08/17/keith-home-report.html) at home. We made more comfortable work of it [this time round](/2015/12/06/keith-away-report.html) and felt we were as ready as we'd ever be for the following weekend. 

The following weekend was, of course, the [top of the table](/2015/12/06/cove-home-preview.html) clash. It received a bit of a [build up](/2015/12/07/cove-home-preview2.html) on here, and excitement was high among the Brora fan base. *Trigger* was back on updates, so the Facebook followers were waiting with baited breath ... *Trigger* captures every detail ...

![The Golden Mic captures every little detail]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-9.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

... every little detail.

Our [match report](/2015/12/13/cove-home-report.html) summed it up in the first paragraph,

*'The most difficult post match decision to be made after this titanic Cattachs performance would be choosing a Man of the Match, in a game where all eleven players plus substitutes gave everything and played the previously unbeaten Cove Rangers off the park.'*

Our player/manager's expression as Stuart Mackenzie was picking the ball from the back of his net did a similar job of capturing just how important we knew this was.

There is no denying it, we really **had** to win that game. What we witnessed one extremely wet night in Huntly had been building up to this performance. And the immediate reward?

![Brora stretch the lead to 6 points mid way through December]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-11.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

A six point gap, and a big message to the rest of the League ... 

The first team to face us after the high of winning the top of the league clash were Fraserburgh. The Broch were the only team who could tame us in the previous two seasons, they were the only other team to take points from Cove this season in the League. The Bellslea boys are not to be trifled with. We were under no illusions about the [dangers of Fraserburgh FC](/2015/12/12/fraserburgh-home-preview.html).

As it was Fraserburgh [weren't ready for us](/2015/12/22/fraserburgh-home-report.html). They certainly weren't ready for Paul Brindle. He was unstoppable. 6-0, 3 points, clean sheet, goal difference stretched again. Time for the Boxing Day fixture.
