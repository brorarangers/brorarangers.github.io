Brora Rangers continued their impressive run of form with a convincing but workmanlike performance against a likeable Deveronvale side at Princess Park Banff. 

The Cattachs returned north to Sutherland with three valuable points after first half goals from Dale Gillespie and Stephen Mackay. 

Brora had some selection difficulties with Brindle, Graham, Porritt and Williamson all absentees through injury, and Zander Sutherland unavailable for inclusion. However there was good news in so far as Captain Steven Mackay had recovered from his leg injury and returned to the starting line up, to partner Andrew Greig and Martin Maclean up front. 

Colin Maclean recalled from his loan spell at Inverness Clachnacuddin was on the bench and was to return to Brora action late in the second half. 

Player Manager Richard Brittain was delighted with the outcome and commented "From the moment we set foot on the pitch for the warm-up our attitude was spot on. We worked very hard at training during the week and everybody knew exactly what was expected of them."

"We set out to use the full width of the pitch and that was shown in our second goal,one of the best you will see anywhere. Our range of passing and composure on the ball was excellent with both our full backs, Ally MacDonald and John Pickles giving us additional wide attacking options" 

 "All in all I thought the whole team played well, and when we had to work hard in the second half, every player rose to the task, kept our shape and discipline and secured the points at a very difficult venue to win at" 

Brora started the far brighter of the two sides with Andrew Greig signalling his intentions from the off and was to give his marker Ross Aitkin a torrid afternoon. Aitkin was to get booked after bringing Greig down, conceeding a  free kick which was to lead to the opening goal. 

Steven Mackay was quick to make his presence felt and could be considered unlucky not to have scored twice in the opening 10 minutes. A back post header was narrowly wide, whist another headed chance rattled the Deveronvale crossbar. 

Brora deservedly took the lead in the 16th minute when Dale Gillespie converted Richard Brittains pin point free kick, with a well placed header as the Vale defence failed to pick up the bearded Cattach. 

Brora fully utilised the full width of the wide park with some wonderful passing which stretched the home defence and allowed the Brora midfield to quickly gain control of the centre ground. 

Deveronvale's only chance of the entire match, came approaching the half time whistle when Chis Blackhall beat the offside trap but his weak shot went well wide. 

The second goal came after a neat passing move, with John Pickes instrumental in delivering a perfect ball into the box, for Steven Mackay to double the Brora lead. 

The second half was largely uneventful with the game becoming a midfield battle with the few chances that were created, falling to Brora who couldn't add to their tally. 

Stephen Mackay did manage to slip the Deveronvale back line and carried the ball around Grant Pennet, but the home keeper brought him down and referee Liam Duncan had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. 

Mackay stepped up to take the penalty himself, but he was not to trouble Pennet, as he slipped when he was about to take his kick, which ended up nearer the corner flag than the goal, with poor Mackay left spread eagled on the turf. Given that Brora had a very comfortable two goal cushion, even the band of travelling supporters had a chuckle at the captains misfortune. 

With 20 minutes remaining, Richard Brittain had to leave the field with a nasty looking leg strain, and was replaced by Stuart Kettlewell who made his presence felt in the middle of the park. Colin Williamson replaced Steven Mackay, but he could add little and the largely uneventful half was drawn to a close, with Brora making it four league clean sheets in succession, ahead of the great north derby against Wick Acadamy on Wednesday.
