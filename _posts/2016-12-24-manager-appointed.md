Brora Rangers Football Club are delighted to announce that Ross Tokely has been appointed to the position of Manager from Saturday 24th December.

Ross won through following the shortlisting of candidates, of which the quality was extremely high.

Speaking on behalf of the club, Chairman William Powrie commented, "The club were blessed and challenged by the high calibre of applicants, who had held a variety of positions in football. It shows if nothing else the regard the Highland League is held in."

In Ross we have someone who is comfortable at the club and knows his way around the league. He has had a very distinguished playing career and at Caley and County has already coached many of our youngsters.

The club would wish to thank Steven MacDonald for his caretaker duties and he too will go on to become a great Manager.

Speaking on his appointment Ross commented "I am delighted to be appointed Manager of Brora Rangers FC and I look forward to our journey together. I would like to thank the Chairman and the Board for this opportunity and belief they shown in my abilities to manage the club.

I have spent nearly 5 years at the club and when the job became available I felt it was the right time to step up to the exciting new challenge.

The chance to manage these extremely talented and hard working group of players was one of the reasons I wanted the job.

I will give everything I have to succeed and win more trophies for this club. The players, myself and the club will continue to compete for The trophies on offer ... I promise you that."
