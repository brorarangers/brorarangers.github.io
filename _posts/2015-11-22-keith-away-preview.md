Brora sit out the Highland league fixtures this coming weekend due to Buckie Thistle's well deserved qualification into the 3rd Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup ... so our next match will be against Keith FC on the 5th December.

We met Keith on home turf back at the start of the season. Remember the start of the season? Warm Saturday afternoons, daylight, shirt-sleeves?

Brora ran out 4-1 victors, but not without a fight, as reported over [here](/2015/08/17/keith-home-report.html), and this was on the back of our 11-0 and 8-1 demolitions of Lossiemouth and Buckie respectively. Chubbs and Zander were the scorers with two apiece that day.

Whilst Brora hang on to their position at the top of the 2015/16 League table on goal difference after a run of 9 wins, Keith currently sit in 12th position. Keith have been unable to chalk up a victory against higher placed opposition since their 1-0 home win over Buckie Thistle back at the start of August.

Brora meanwhile found their shooting boots against Rothes last Saturday with Dale Gillespie, John McLeod, Andrew Greig, Martin Maclean, Grant Munro and Lewis Grant all finding the net.

The Highland League fixtures have come through Storms Abigail and Barney relatively unscathed. Hopefully this weather continues to behave favourably as the Brora Rangers supporters will be keeping a close eye on how Keith cope with Cove Rangers this coming weekend.

Did we mention that Brora are scheduled to meet Cove Rangers on our home turf on the 12th December? We will, possibly more than once between now and then.

|                | P  | W  | D | L | GF | GA | Pts|
|----------------|----|----|---|---|----|----|----|
| Brora Rangers  | 20 | 17 | 1 | 2 | 75 | 16 | 52 |
| Cove Rangers   | 18 | 17 | 1 | 0 | 54 | 12 | 52 |
| Formartine Utd | 19 | 15 | 2 | 2 | 72 | 18 | 47 |

You really can't squeeze a Brora Rangers Lotto ticket between top 3 right now and every point matters in the run up to the end of the year.

So enjoy your weekend off, and get your diary sorted out for a trip to Keith on the 5th of December. The Supporters Club will be running a bus and details will be updated here closer to the time.
