With Dale Pryde MacDonald stepping down from the Head of Youth position, the U20’s team will revert into the A team line.

U20s Manager Mark McKernie who led the team to the runners up spot last season commented, “I am itching to get going again. I have spoken to both Steven and Craig this week. I’m looking forward to working with them. Hopefully we can get a few U20’s up to the senior squad throughout the season. I’ll work tirelessly to encourage it. Im looking forward to an exciting new season at the club, hopefully a successful one”

Club Chairman William Powrie commented “ It is important the we start seeing a progression of players from our U20’s team into the A Team. The alignment of the U20’s into the A Team line will considerably help with this objective. Mark will receive invaluable support from Steven and Cammy and synergies between the squads can develop. Mark is just the man to make this happen.”
