Let's start with a bit of trivia to kick off the run up to Scottish Cup weekend at Dudgeon Park.

Which team is currently sitting 3rd in their league, 4 points behind the current leaders? 

Chances are, your answer is probably going to depend on whether you're one of our regular visitors getting ready for our Scottish Cup build up, or a new visitor checking out the opposition before the long trip up the A9 next Saturday.

Chances are, you're going to be correct anyway. As we head into another meeting between Brora Rangers and Clyde, both teams sit in third place in their respective Leagues. Brora are 4 points adrift of Buckie (for now), Clyde sit below Elgin City, and our pre-season opponents Forfar Athletic.

Those of you who followed our Scottish Cup warm up against Arbroath last season will be aware we have a love of historical connections and tenuous links when it comes to the big occasion ... so let's go.

We got our first chance in the Scottish Cup back in the 1955-56 season. A defeat away to Eyemouth Utd prevented progress to the 2nd round that year. The current Scottish Cup holders that season didn't get involved until the 5th round. They beat Dunfermline Athletic, Stenhousemuir and Queen of the South on their way to set up a replay of the previous final at Hampden Park. A game against Celtic. This time they were unable to overcome the Parkhead side and get to another final. The 1954-55 Scottish Cup winners, Clyde FC, lost 2-1. For fans of BBC Radio Scotland's Off the Ball, the famous Tommy Ring scored the goal that won the cup for Clyde in April 1955. For Fraserburgh fans, yes, *that* Tommy Ring.

Oh yes, Clyde FC have a pedigree when it comes to the Scottish Cup. That was the 2nd time they'd won the Scottish Cup. They got their hands on it again in 1957-58.

Probably their most notable period as reigning Scottish Cup holders was from the 1938-39 season to 1946-47. We are not suggesting for a second that the Bully Wee had a hand in orchestrating the Britain's involvement in WWII just to hang on to the oldest trophy in association football, but hang on to it they did, for 8 years.

1958 is a long time ago though. We've got over our defeat in 1956, we've forgiven Arbroath for putting us out in 1957, we've moved on from our defeat at the hands of Hamilton Academical. Even Buckie Thistle will be forgiven knocking us out in a 1979 replay as long as they carry on settling for low scoring draws in the League for the remainder of the season. We hold our heads high as we remember meetings against Dundee and Queen of the South. We'll reconsider our feelings about the Arbroath second round game last season, who knows, if they can overcome University of Stirling this weekend, we might just get a chance for revenge for that one anyway.

Just as there is a certain amount of rawness to our recent Arbroath memory, we suspect Clyde will still have fresh memories of their William Hill Scottish Cup tie against a Highland League club last season. The long trip to a small village so far north of the Tay few had heard of it, or their football club. The even longer trip back home after an undistinguished defeat at the hands of Formartine Utd.

Aye, Formartine Utd. The same Formartine Utd who Brora just dealt a 4-1 victory out to last weekend.

So we're both sitting 3rd in our respective Leagues. We're both well within touching distance of that top spot. We've both had moments of glory and pain in this competition.

It's all adding up to be a cracking Cup tie. It's too early in the week to get our [Match Preview](/fixtures/) written up, but rest assured, there are several more links between our two clubs to investigate before Saturday comes.

It isn't too early, however, to get your [Match Day Hospitality](/2016/10/13/clyde-hospitality/) sorted out. Make the most of the occasion, treat yourself and your friends or clients to a 3 course lunch and all the trimmings, and get ready to enjoy all the excitement of the Scottish Cup.
