As a reward for knocking two League 1 clubs out of the William Hill Scottish Cup this season, Brora Rangers are back on the road again.

It's another 500 mile round trip from Dudgeon Park, but after the turnout at Bayview Stadium in the previous round, we suspect that won't deter many from attending this historic match to back the Reds.
