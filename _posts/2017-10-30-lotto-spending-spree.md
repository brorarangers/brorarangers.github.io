Yesterday we considered what we would do with a Cattachs Lotto win, finally cancelling plans for a trip to Madrid in favour of Mosset Park.

Today we've decided to blow the **£7,300.00** Jackpot on something to benefit more than a couple of us on a luxury weekend.

The Brora Rangers Supporters Club really live up to their name. Their support goes beyond turning up home and away to cheer on the lads and enjoy a Saturday with friends. The funds they raise every season are vital to the Club; their attendance at games is invaluable.

We think the Brora Rangers Supporters Club deserve their own transport, and we've found this 1990 Volvo 57 seater for a bargain £4,800.00. It is very obviously the wrong colour, but we've been given an estimate of £3,000.00 for a full prep and respray.

However, they are classy bunch of travellers, and the added cost of luxury upholstery and the oh so necessary toilet is going to be beyond our budget unless the Cattachs Lotto continues to roll over for a good few months. Perhaps we need to look for something else. Something with a it more panache, and hopefully a bit lighter on fuel costs.

Mercedes-Benz - that's definitely more the style for our travelling supporters. £4,000.00 for the vehicle, less body to respray in glorious Brora Red and 11 years newer, so the seats should still be comfy enough at least until Fochabers and a stop at The Grant Arms. However, it only has 17 seats ... barely enough for a wet Wednesday night trip to Fraserburgh, never mind the Saturday Cup Final and Scottish Cup exodus.

Back to the drawing board, and back to the stalwarts in the Supporters Club booking buses for the trips around the League and further afield.

Meanwhile, we need to stop dreaming and actually get our [Lotto Standing Order](/lotto/) filled in!
