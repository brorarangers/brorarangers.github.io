Brora Rangers are back on the road this week with away League games on Wednesday and Saturday. First up is the annual visit to Strathspey Thistle's Seafield Park.

Strathspey have recorded home wins over Huntly, Fort William and most recently Clachnacuddin, but with the exception of a one sided affair against Nairn County back in November, have been putting together many strong performances on home turf.

It's down to our last 6 League games for the 2015/16 season and every game is vital. Our 1-1 draw against Inverurie Locos at the weekend certainly adds to the excitement for all as we near the closing stages.

Our last meeting back in October saw Brora run out 3-0 winners with 2 goals from Paul Brindle and Colin Williamson grabbing his first goal of the season. Our last visit to Seafield Park saw a goalfest with Steven Mackay, Scott Graham, Dale Gillespie and Martin Maclean all finding the net with 7 goals between them.

It's all to play for at the top of the table, and no-one can take anythng for granted. It's looking like a dry clear night on Grantown-on-Spey and a strong away support is just the thing to help the lads keep this title challenge alive and kicking.
