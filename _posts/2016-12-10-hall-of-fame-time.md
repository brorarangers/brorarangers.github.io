The Club are delighted to announce that this years Hall of Fame dinner is to be held in the Social Club on 3rd February 2017.

This was a fantastic success last season, when the first 5 very worthy nominees were elected into the our "Hall of Fame".

This year we will be looking for a further 2 worthy candidate's to join them and voting has opens on Sunday 11th December. Voting will be by the usual Social Media channels and nomination forms will also be available at the ground on match days. Please make every effort to vote.

Our current Hall of Fame includes:

#### Donald Mackay

Donald made his Brora Rangers debut at only 13 years old, and played with the Scotland Under 18 team. Hearts Manager Bobby Moncur was unable to persuade Donald throughout his career to move to Edinburgh and  no lure was big enough, as Donald wanted to complete his apprenticeship in Golspie and continue playing for his local club.

A talented forward, 'Donald Red' - so named for his mop of red hair - was first spotted as a schoolboy by Willie Thornton of Rangers. In the event, love of his native Sutherland proved too strong, and he never left Highland League football, though not before talent scouts had taken him south to have trials with Arsenal, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. Donald died suddenly in 2004 but his skills on the Football field will never be forgotten.

#### Bobby Duffy

Bobby arrived as Player/Manager from Vale of Leven in 1978.  In his playing career he played on the right wing of a St Mirren team that included Archie Gemmill, Gordon McQueen, Bobby McKean and and Jackie Copeland.  Has two Scottish Junior International Team Caps and guided Club to the Qualifying Cup in 1979, and to their highest league finish the following season.

 Now retired and living in Dumbarton, members of his family still live in Brora today.

#### Douglas Norris

Dugga was made club captain at only 23 years old and captained the team in our 1979 Qualifying Cup victory.

To this day he remains one of the most influential players that has ever donned the red jersey of Brora, and his on-field commitment and leadership was undoubted.

He went on to manage Brora Wanderers, Bunilidh Thistle & Bonar Bridge. Dugga remains heavily involved within the club and his charismatic presence is evident in his current role as Manager of Brora Social Club.

#### John Young

John has played several roles at the club from Player, Physio, Committee Member and now Chairman.

He took over as Chairman in 1990's and oversaw the Club claim their first League Championships. A stalwart of the club, John, with others, kept the club going through some quite dark days and is respected throughout the Highland League community as a true ambassador of the game.

Without doubt John will go down in history for being one of the most committed and dedicated people the club has ever seen.

#### Ronnie MacDonald

Ronnie arrived in Brora 1945 and always harboured the ambition for Brora Rangers to join the Highland League. He befriended key figures in North Football to support Brora's application which was  eventually successful in 1962 and fulfilled his ambition to see BRFC as members of the Highland League.

He fought long and hard over the years to keep the club afloat, attracting players from all over the north as well as quality coaches and managers. He helped guide the team to the 1979 Qualifying Cup, the club's first ever silverware. He also helped guide the club to North of Scotland Cups in 1981 and 1991 and was also at the helm when Brora faced off with Dundee in the Scottish Cup.

His spirit still attends every match and kicks every ball and he would be incredibly proud of where the club has come over the past 4 years.

#### Sandy Matheson

Sandy is an ever present at Dudgeon Park and has been associated with the club since he was a boy.

Sandy has taken care of the club ground for 41 years, and has developed through loving care and attention one of the best playing surfaces in the Highland League.
