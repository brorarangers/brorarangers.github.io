We continue our look back at our season so far right at the point where we were preparing to meet Cove Rangers for what was always going to be one of the crunch games of the Highland League.

By this stage we'd crashed out of the North of Scotland Cup on penalties to Wick Academy and had a narrow defeat in the 1st Round of the Petrofac Training Cup to the current runners up, Alloa Athletic, but the real aim of retaining our League Championship was well on track.

Football can be a funny old game, (alternatively, choose your [own tired cliche from here](http://soccerlens.com/football-cliches/86789/)), but we were all pretty sure that the real challengers for the title were going to come from the same Clubs as were already filling the top 4 spots in the table by mid August. None of them had met each other yet, only Formartine had dropped points in a fiercely contested 4-3 loss to Inverurie Locos. While Brora had scored 26 goals and only conceded one a piece to Buckie and Keith, Cove's games appeared to be more tightly contested affairs ... indeed they were coming into this match after a 2-3 win over Strathspey Thistle. It's fair to say confidence was high in the Brora camp ... plus, we had a secret weapon up our sleeve.

We are all aware of the futility of building a football club if you have no fans, and fans become even more important in big away fixtures.

So we were recruiting ...

![Brora Scarecrow Festival produced a few more followers for Brora Rangers]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-2.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

It should be pointed out for clarity that the scarecrow on the far right already attends several games. This was the weekend of Brora's inaugural [Scarecrow Festival](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-34044817) and the supporters bus headed for Harlaw Park waved off by several new fans clad in Brora Rangers shirts.

Anyone who follows the Highland League already knows what happened on the afternoon of August 22nd at Harlaw Park. Ironically it was the weekend we decided our new website was ready for launch, and so this was the first [match report](/2015/08/24/cove-away-report.html) officially announced on brorarangers.football.

Coincidently a new contender for the Golden Mic popped up on Facebook for the first time ...

![The next Golden Mic contender pops up]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-3.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Keeping in the spirit of not revealing the true identity of our reporters, much like Top Gear's Stig, let's call this individual *Ruth*. She put up a valiant effort in the first half, and was obviously approaching the mid-way point with confidence. We didn't hear from her again that day.

Let's get things into perspective here. This was our first League defeat since Fraserburgh took 3 points away from Dudgeon Park in December 2013. That was 57 games ago.

Talking of coincidences, it was to Fraserburgh we were bound next at a time we knew it was imperative to bounce back quickly.

Our new website was [officially launched](/2015/08/25/new-website.html) on the 24th August, and in keeping with the revitalised digital face of the Club, our Twitter feed received a bit of a spruce up too. We were able to put it to good use almost on the stroke of half time at Bellslea.

![Brora Rangers new Twitter feed announces its first goal]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-4.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

And we were off again. [Fraserburgh 1-2 Brora](http://brorarangers.football/2015/08/30/fraserburgh-away-report.html). This match also produced the best Facebook running commentary of the season so far, no codding.

Our attention was diverted from the playing side of things briefly for our [Celebration Ball](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/04/celebration-dinner.html) on Friday the 4th of September. Held in the Kingsmills Hotel, it was a fantastic night, enjoyed by all and a great fundraiser for the Club.

A workman like performance the following afternoon earned us a 3-0 victory against Clachnacuddin at home, and while the [official report](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/06/clach-home-report.html) from ourselves was perhaps somewhat lacking, Golden Mic contender *Ruth* was bringing match commentary to a new level.

![Golden Mic reporting at its finest]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-5.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

![Golden Mic reporting ensuring everyone is included]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-6.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Not to be outdone, our Twitter feed upped the ante by including bonny photos of our bonny goal scorers. Let's not be coy here, we are becoming proud of our digital communications at Brora Rangers Football Club.

![The Brora Rangers Twitter feed really gets going]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-7.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

Onwards next to a Wednesday night match against Nairn County at Station Park. Going in at half time 0-1 up, what happened next was described by our website reporter as the [performance of the season](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/09/nairn-away-report.html) as the lads added a further 6 goals to record a 1-7 victory. If you think our official match report was ebullient, step forward the Golden Mic for the night, lets call him *Killie Pieman*.

At one stage he even told us something about the game taking place.

He takes his pies seriously ...

To be fair, he came to the same conclusion as all who were there to witness the 2nd half demolition of a Nairn side who had only lost twice this far in the season, both times by a single goal.

This is a perfect point to put joking aside for a moment. Running a football club at any level is a huge task. When you sign up to the Board or Committee you accept that the football is going to require more than just a trip to see your team play every weekend before retiring gracefully to the bar. We, in common with our fellow Highland League clubs, also have a small army of loyal supporters who give time and expertise in a myriad of different ways.

Our Supporters Club Facebook page is a 'Closed Group', you need to ask the Group Admins to join. This isn't because the Supporters Club are a cliquey lot, far from it, they currently have just shy of 700 members on the page, but the online world is already full enough of people happy to misquote, misuse and generally abuse from the safety of their keyboard. The page is not only used for the Match Updates we've used in this article, but also to organise buses to away games, alert supporters to website updates, share photos from home and away days, organise Supporters Club meetings and generally help with communication between the Club and our supporters. Many of our players are on the page, and it lets those both on and off the field show their appreciation of each other. Whilst we are ambitious, and make no secret of our intent to win trophies and promotion, we all value the connection between our Directors, management and coaching team, players and those who faithfully follow the Club. It is a fantastic medium for building interest in our Club and helping the fans feel part of our big Red Family. To all those who administer, and all those who contribute, we salute you. Probably one of the best examples of how important, and effective, the Facebook page is came to fruition just before our match against Nairn.

Back in June a post appeared from a supporter suggesting that they could set up a fund with minimal yet regular payments throughout the year. Those paying into the fund would then have some say in how, and when, the proceeds were spent. A seed was sown, quite a bit of discussion took place on the page, and subsequently in meetings. 3 months later the Supporters Club announced [BRIT](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/06/improvement-trust-launch.html), the Brora Rangers Improvement Trust.

![The Brora Rangers Improvement Trust is launched by their Supporters Club]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-13.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}


[BRIT](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/06/improvement-trust-launch.html) is administered by a group of supporters, controlled by the supporters, and the funds are for ground improvements or other projects which those contributing feel will be beneficial to the future of the Club. It is a fantastic bit of work from some of the unsung heroes of Brora Rangers.

Given the contribution that our supporters make to the Club, they're bound to feature again, but back to League business. And big business it was too.

Formartine Utd had made absolutely no secret of their desire to win the League, win the Play Offs and make a meteoric rise from Juniors to SPFL in double quick time.

Even at this early stage in the season, it was obvious the top 4 weren't going to be very forgiving when it came to any slip ups. Turriff were out in front with 7 wins and a draw, though Cove were the only unbeaten team with 7 wins from 7. The Pitmedden club and ourselves were both on 21 points with 7 wins and a loss each. It was beginning to feel like another crunch game already. The winner of this game would finish the day top of the table.

Our headline said it all, [Brora undone by Formartine](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/14/formartine-home-report.html). Garry Wood, he's a villain no matter who he's playing for! First the winning goal in our final game against Montrose, and now the opening goal in the game that sent us to 4th in the League overnight.

On a brighter note, yet another contender appeared for the Golden Mic ... OK, let's call him *Trigger*, he certainly had the fastest fingers we'd seen so far.

![Another Golden Mic contender tries his hand]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-15.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

He was also a bit more polite and professional than anything we'd experienced before.

![The Golden Mic goes wild at Brora Rangers v Formartine]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-16.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

He pretty much kept this up all game, every kick of the ball. 4 posts in 2 minutes. Unheard of.

![Brora Rangers answer to Archie MacPherson]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-17.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

All game, every kick of the ball ... *Trigger* was a machine. Facebook followers hadn't seen anything like it. 

Despite *Trigger* keeping this blow by blow account of proceedings up for 90 minutes, there was evidence that the current Golden Mic holder was about as keen to give up his crown as the players were on the pitch.

![The Golden Mic pretender is put in his place]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-18.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

It's a pretty much general rule in life, football and match reporting; you can't undo what's been done. Learn from your mistakes and move on. And move on we did ... to the foot of Ben Nevis and the glorious Claggan Park.

The Fort had a terrific season in 2014/15 but didn't seem to be building on it so far just now, with several set backs both onfield and off, not least of which was a [devastating fire](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-33428507) in their changing rooms. This was also the weekend of shinty's Camanachd Cup Final being played down the road in Oban, and Fort William's place in the MacMaster Cup for the youngsters being a prelude to Shinty's showcase final meant that the Brora away support outnumbered the home fans. Whilst Brora ran out eventual winners, we met yet another villain. 

Our [match report](/2015/09/21/fortwilliam-away-report.html) seems to mention a certain John McLeod several times. A man with the temerity to score a hat-trick against Brora. A feat that no-one has achieved since Martin Charlesworth way back in February 2013 for Deveronvale. Definitely the villain of the day.

![Brora's Captain Sid Mackay tucks the ball into the back of Fort William's net]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-19.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

However, a 3-5 victory, 3 points, and on to the last match of the second part of our end of year round up.

Along with our next opponents, Turriff Utd, our involvement in the William Hill Scottish Cup didn't begin until the 2nd Round, but the rest of the Highland League were all getting ready to [Defy the Odds](http://brorarangers.football/2015/09/24/scottish-cup-round1.html). Cove Rangers, Buckie Thistle, Clachnacuddin, Formartine Utd, Fraserburgh, Huntly, Inverurie Locos, Forres, Nairn County and Fort William all made it through to the next round at the first time of asking, and Wick Academy joined us in the 2nd Round after a replay against Whitehill Welfare. The draw for the next round pulled Brora out of the hat to face [Arbroath](http://brorarangers.football/2015/10/01/scottish-cup-draw.html) in what promised to be an exciting home tie.

League business first though, and another clash of the Top 4 ... Turriff Utd.

|Team| P | W | D | L | GD |Pts|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Formartine United | 10 | 9 | 0 | 1 | 28 | 27|
| Cove Rangers | 9 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 18 | 27| 
| Turriff United | 10 | 8 | 1 | 1 | 29 | 25| 
| Brora Rangers | 10 | 8 | 0 | 2 | 31 | 24|
| Wick Academy | 10 | 6 | 0 | 4 | 10 | 18| 
| Nairn County | 10 | 6 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 18| 
| Buckie Thistle | 10 | 6 | 0 | 4 | -5 | 18| 
| Inverurie Locos | 10 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 15| 
| Forres Mechanics | 10 | 5 | 0 | 5 | -3 | 15| 

A look at the top half of the league table at the time shows us not quite a third of the way through the season and the main contenders for the title were pulling away. The defeats at the hands of Cove Rangers and Formartine Utd had put a dent in our challenge, and we knew we couldn't afford to slip up in our first meeting with the last of the title hopefuls. The way the fixtures had fallen, neither Cove, Formartine nor Turriff had faced each other yet and it was looking like the title would be decided on how we fared against each other. Like we say, we couldn't slip up.

![Brora's Colin Williamson leaves the field before half time after his second yellow]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/{{ page.url | replace: '/','-' | remove_first: '-' | remove: '.html' }}-20.jpg){: .responsive-img .z-depth-2 .post-image}

OK, [we slipped up](http://brorarangers.football/2015/10/05/turriff-home-report.html). Colin Williamson's second yellow card of the match arrived 5 minutes before half time, and whilst we remained at 0-0 going into the break, Turriff took the lead within 10 minutes of the battle recommencing. A wonder free kick from Richie Brittain around 10 mins from the final whistle saw us finish 1-1, and there was no doubt that we were the team happier with the full time result. 

We entered the 2nd third of the League camaign in fourth place, and it was obvious something had to change ... which is the perfect place to take a break from our end of year review before we move on to our third and final round up.
