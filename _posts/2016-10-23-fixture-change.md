Our scheduled Christmas Eve match against Lossiemouth has been moved forward to the 23rd December.

The rescheduled game will now kick off at 8pm on the Friday night.

Our [home fixture against The Coasters](/2016/08/31/lossiemouth-home-report/) this season brought a sackful of goals for Brora; let's hope we can bring more seasonal cheer to the Red Army in this festive fixture.
