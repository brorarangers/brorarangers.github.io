Brora Rangers are delighted to have secured the signature of Fort William forward John Mcleod on a 2.5 year contract.

Club Chairman John Young said" John is a strong hard working player who has scored goals regularly throughout his career. 
Brora unsuccessfully tried to entice John to the club when he was a youngster starring for Clachnacuddinâ€™s youth teams"

"We now welcome him into the squad where hopefully he will be an instant success and enjoy his involvement with Brora Rangers"

Player Manager Richard Brittain commented that " he has been tracking John for several months now and has watched him over a number games. He is a striker that that will compliment the existing front line at Brora and will keep our challenge for the league title to the fore"

"We have several key plays out with injuries at present, and club captain Steven Mackay has had to return to USA with work commitments so his arrival is most timeous".
