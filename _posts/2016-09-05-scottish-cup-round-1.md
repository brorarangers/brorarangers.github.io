It's Scottish Cup time again for most of the Highland League Clubs. Formartine Utd and Cove Rangers get to sit this one out, but ball number 4 this year was Brora Rangers ...

We didn't have long to wait long to be drawn against Fort William at Claggan Park to kick of our William Hill Scottish Cup campaign for 2016-17.

The first round draws will be held on the 24th September and there will be few involved with the Club that will be unhappy with this draw, not least the travelling support who always enjoy the trip, and the afternoon, in  The Fort.

The full 1st Round draw is:

 - **Turriff United** v Bonnyrigg Rose
 - Leith Athletic v Cumbernauld Colts
 - **Fort William v Brora Rangers**
 - **Forres Mechanics** v **Lossiemouth**
 - East Kilbride v Vale of Leithen
 - BSC Glasgow v **Rothes**
 - **Deveronvale** v Gretna 2008
 - **Keith** v Banks o' Dee
 - Edinburgh University v Whitehill Welfare
 - Gala Fairydean Rovers v **Fraserburgh**
 - Beith Juniors or Auchinleck Talbot v **Strathspey Thistle**
 - Civil Service Strollers v Hawick Royal Albert
 - **Nairn County** v Preston Athletic
 - **Inverurie Loco Works** v **Buckie Thistle**
 - **Clachnacuddin** v Stirling University
 - Dalbeattie Star v **Wick Academy**
 - Selkirk v Linlithgow Rose
 - Girvan v **Huntly**
 
 We are one of only 3 all Highland League ties this season. 

It was confirmed this afternoon that a fourth substitute will be permitted from this round onwards if a game goes into extra time.
