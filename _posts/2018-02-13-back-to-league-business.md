After a delightful extended Scottish Cup run, and some less than delightful winter weather, it is time to turn our attention back to League business.

Since the start of November we've seen no less than five league games postponed thanks to our involvement in the North of Scotland Cup Final, an abandoned and rearranged Breedon League Cup tie and the William Hill Scottish Cup. A further five matches were postponed due to the prolonged wintery spell that doesn't appear to be finished quite yet.

We hope to get back to League business on Wednesday night, with a [trip to Seafield Park](/2018/02/14/strathspey-away/), but winter definitely hasn't left the eastern Cairngorms yet, so keep an eye on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/) for updates regarding pitch inspections.

Other rearranged matches see us travelling to Grant Street Park to play Clachnacuddin on Wednesday 21st February, away to Cove Rangers on Wednesday 28th February and home on Wednesday 7th March for the return leg of The North Derby.

With the final League match of the season already set for Saturday 14th April, when we host Cove Rangers, and the 24th of February already earmarked for our Breedon Highland League Cup tie at Dudgeon Park against Turriff Utd, that leaves us with only four free Saturdays to squeeze in seven League fixtures. You can strike Saturday 10th of March off that list too if all goes well against Turriff on the 24th as the winner of that tie will be travelling to Keith looking for a place in the Semi Final of the League Cup.

So 'Saturday - Wednesday - Saturday' football time it is again, not necesarily a bad thing for those who can catch up on their footy fix twice a week, but having games that traditionally attract a healthy Hospitality attendance shifted from a Saturday afternoon to a Wednesday evening can have a detrimental effect on all the Highland League clubs.

However, there is little any of us can do about the weather, and who amongst us would swap our Scottish Cup run for a couple of extra League games?

It all boils down to this:

 - 15 League fixtures to be fulfilled over the next 9 weeks
 - 45 points sitting waiting to be won, with a final tally of 86 points the goal.

Every point is a prisoner. The players were quick to recognise the difference that the noise of the supporters made during our trips to Stranraer and East Fife, let's keep the ball rolling and roar the lads on throughout the rest of the season.
