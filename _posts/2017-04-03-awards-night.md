Saturday the 8th of April sees the last of our Saturday League home games at Dudgeon Park as we welcome Huntly FC for what could be an extremely important match for us.

Regardless of the result, there will be celebrations following the final whistle as we will be presenting our Player of the Year Awards in the Social Club at 6pm.

Voting slips will be available on the gate at the Huntly game where you can cast your vote for Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year. The squad will be voting for their Player of the Year, and the Brora Rangers Supporters Club will also be presenting an award for the Supporters Club Player of the Year.

It's been a season of changes for Brora Rangers, and competition for the top spot of the Highland League gets tougher and tougher as the standard of football on display increases, and the room for error decreases. With Buckie Thistle, Cove Rangers and ourselves all currently sitting within 3 points of each other, and Formartine Utd sitting with two games in hand over us, it is impossible not to think back to some of our past slip ups as the season moves quickly to its conclusion.

However, we are now at a point within 3 games of completing our League campaign with much to celebrate. Our competitors have some tough encounters yet to come, we have the North of Scotland Cup in our sights, and few would disagree that since the appointment of Ross as our manager there appears to be a rejuvenated air of determination about the squad. And that is going to make your voting all the harder on Saturday afternoon.

Over the coming days and weeks Fraserburgh, Turriff Utd, Lossiemouth, Forres Mechanics and Formartine Utd themselves can all play a large part in where the League title ends up ... then again, so can Huntly, Wick Academy and Fort William. But when you pick up your voting slip on Saturday afternoon, celebrate. It's been a long, hard season.

If you are one of the fantastic crew who hardly miss a game, home or away (and you know who you are), take some time out on Friday evening to replay all these games in your mind. If you are in the more typical situation of catching games when you can, following matches on Facebook, catching up on results on here or through Social Media, take a read back through all our [match reports](/results/). It probably won't make the decision any easier, but it's a fine way to spend an evening.

See you on Saturday at the awards ceremony.
