We've been here before ... as far back as the 16th January, when our preview spoke [more about the weather](/2016/01/15/fort-william-home-preview.html) than any statistics regarding previous meetings of the two Clubs.


A frozen pitch (along with the rest of the league apart from Fraserburgh) put paid to that game.

We had another go on the 2nd March, where, amazingly, we were hoping to get our [second home league game](/2016/02/29/fort-william-home-preview.html) of 2016 underway.

This time round it was a waterlogged pitch, again in common with the rest of the day's fixtures apart from Nairn County's Station Park.

Here we are, exactly two months on from the original fixture date and supremely confident that this time Mother Nature is in our favour.

The Brora squad come into this game on the back of two thrilling League Cup battles against our main competitors for the League Championship, both forced into extra time on heavy pitches, both requiring penalty shoot outs to claim victory. Now we can get back to League business and chip away at our 8 remaining fixtures in the race for a Play-off place.

Spirits will no doubt be high in the Fort William squad, with a 2-2 draw against Lossiemouth and a 3-1 victory over Rothes under their belt this month already. There was no doubt that they gave us a run for our money in an [8 goal thriller](/2015/09/21/fortwilliam-away-report.html) back in September - though their hat-trick hero then has become one of our premier penalty shoot out practitioners in our [League Cup Quarter Final](/2016/03/07/formartine-away-report.html). That's quite a display of adaptability from one of the Highland League's top scorers.

There's every chance this could be another high scoring game, and with the weather forecast promising a mild and calm evening, we look forward to welcoming you to Dudgeon Park for an 8pm kick-off on Wednesday 16th.
