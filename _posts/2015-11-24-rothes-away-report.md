Lewis Grant , still completing his sixth year studies, seized the opportunity presented to him through John Pickles absence, by turning in a "man of the match" performance and bagging a brace of well taken goals, in Brora Rangers 7-0 victory at Rothes on Saturday. 

On a bitterly cold day, Brora turned in a sizzling first half display and went in at the break seven goals to the good, having built on recent past performances and extending their current run to nine league games. 

Speaking after the game player manager Richard Brittain was delighted with the overall performance and the work rate that all of his team put in. "I was delighted to be able to start Lewis and he rose to my challenge, turning in a memorable performance and scoring a couple of well taken goals. He worked so hard and added supporting width to our game as we attacked." 

"We started in the manner I asked for and secured the three points early in the first half. The players have a real desire and appetite to win as was evident by them celebrating our seventh goal as if it were the first. We are playing very well at present and our confidence levels are high." 

Brora started very quickly and both Greig and Sutherland had chances, before Gillespie opened the scoring with a long range dipping strike. 

Recent arrival John McLeod made it two with a close range poke and Martin Maclean finished well to add a third within the opening 15 minutes.

There was to be no rest-bite for the hard pressed Rothes defence as Lewis Grant popped up to add a double to his name and end the game as a contest. Lewis who was playing right back, was a constant thorn in the side of the Rothes defence with his incisive attacking runs. 

Dale Gillespie added his second and Broras sixth before Grant Munro showed he can still produce some nimble footwork as he danced around the Rothes back line to make it a magnificent seven.

Rothes Manager Fraser Bremner reorganised his side for the second period and the plucky Rothes side mounted a rearguard action, comparable to any military manoeuvre and supported by heroics from Mathew Mackie in the Rothes goal, managed to prevent any further goals from the visitors. Brora will be disappointed that they did not add to their goal tally, as convertible chances went begging to Greig, Sutherland, Macleod, Martin MacLean, Colin Maclean, Gillespie and MacDonald.

At the other end of the park, Joe Malin concluded his goalkeeping duties without having to make a save throughout the afternoon. 

After a busy two weeks, Brora have a free Saturday this week, before travelling to Keith on 5th December.
