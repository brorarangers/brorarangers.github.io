#### Coincidence, Providence and Tenuous Links

Let's turn the clock back a few years. 35 years in fact, to the 1980/81 footballing season. In football terms, Celtic topped the Premier Division, with Aberdeen snapping at their heels. Kilmarnock finished 2nd to bottom and suffered the subsequent relegation to Division 1, swapping places with a victorious Hibernian. Gordon Strachan was pulling on his boots (and scoring) for the National Squad rather than the manager's jacket, and Peterhead were up against a formidable Rangers side in a Cup Final.

**The formidable Brora Rangers, in the Highland League Cup Final.**

Zip forward to the present day, and amongst all the other obvious comparisons, Brora Rangers are back at the League Cup Final again. This time at the happy hunting ground of Grant Street Park in Inverness, facing two times winners Nairn County. We've been collecting a few trophies ourselves over the years, starting with the Scottish Qualifying Cup and adding the North of Scotland Cup, Inverness Cup and Highland League Championships. But the League Cup has proved somewhat elusive ... so far.

The first Highland League Cup was contested in 1946, with Forres claiming victory then and on a further 6 subsequent occasions. Keith FC are the record holders, collecting the trophy 10 times, most recently in 2013 after a 2-1 victory over Inverurie Loco Works. This year as the current holders wrestle to relieve us of the League Championship, we'll be hoping to snatch the silverware from Cove's cabinet. 

This season, it was a relatively commanding 4-1 victory over a tough Inverurie Loco Works that saw us through the first round, setting us up for a memorable Quarter Final clash with Formartine Utd at North Lodge Park. If we kicked off this article with a touch of the H.G. Wells time travelling scenario, it seems appropriate to quote some Shakespeare with *'Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them'* rhetoric. There is no doubt that Brora Rangers, both as a Club, and the playing squad have achieved greatness, both in seasons from decades past, and in our more recent history. When it comes to greatness being thrust upon an individual, step forward recent signing John McLeod.

In a game where it was generally agreed by all who witnessed it, that those who participated in the match achieved greatness, our November signing from Fort William definitely found greatness thrust upon him. After what is technically described in football parlance as a 'humdinger of a game', an injury to Brora keeper Joe Malin saw him forced to leave the field of play early in extra time. With all Brora's substitution slots used up in the effort to grab the winning goal, it was striker McLeod who stepped forward and donned the goalies gear. With the game stuck at five goals apiece, no additional scoring in extra time saw John thrust in to a penalty shoot out, with the opposite view from his accustomed position. His save of Formartine's 4th penalty was enough to see us progress into the semi final against current holders, Cove Rangers.

Sometimes, whether you're in the world of H.G. Wells and his time machine, or just rehashing and misquoting Shakespeare, it appears history can just keep repeating itself. The semi final was a repeat of the quarter final, with ascendency swinging from side to side, both teams level after full time, a draw after extra time, penalty shoot outs, and Brora with a new keeper between the sticks. Steven Martin has waited very patiently for his chance to be the hero for Brora. With Cove hitting the woodwork twice, he had to bide his time and pull off a fantastic save from Duff's spot kick to have his moment. Brora Rangers were, at last, back in a League Cup final.

Back to the 1980/81 League Cup campaign, and we find our route to the final was incredibly similar. A comfortable 2-0 home victory over Clachnacuddin in the opening round, followed by two significantly tougher fixtures.

Away to Victoria Park for a quarter final against our then local rivals, Ross County. Another tough game, another close run affair. But goals from Brora's MacFarlane and Jackson saw us run out 1-2 winners and the semi final beckoned.

This time it was a trip to Borough Briggs to face Elgin City, just ourselves, Elgin City and over 1000 fans. MacFarlane was the hero again scoring both of the Cattachs goals in another hard fought 1-2 victory. League Cup Final time for the Cattachs. Just like this season, Peterhead FC won through to a glamour game against the Rangers, the Brora Rangers.

Peterhead, The Blue Toon, Highland League Cup winners in '62/63, '65/66 and '67/68. Scottish Qualifying Cup winners in '75/76, '77/78 and '78/79.

Scottish Qualifying Cup finalists in '79/80. 

The losing Qualifying Cup finalists. 

Losing to Brora Rangers. 

Losing 5-0 in a replay. 

5-0.

It was a legendary Brora squad who lined up against the Blue Tooners on the 3rd September to face a Peterhead team hell bent on revenge. Suttar, Kennedy (Duffy), Allan, Norris, Christie, Sokolowski, D. MacAskill, McCafferty, Jackson, Hamilton and Mackay. Unfortunately, the only name on the scoresheet that day was Nat Porter of Peterhead.

It wasn't our last trip to the League Cup Final, we were back the following season, more of which later, but while we are looking at coincidence, providence and any other tenuous links with which to weave a tale ...

Romping home to a commanding Cup Final win in one competition only to find us facing the same team in another Cup Final within a short space of time, if only such a thing occurred to round off our first article neatly. Nairn County, Grant Street Park, Cup Final ... got it!

October 2013, Nairn County 0-3 Brora Rangers. The North of Scotland Cup came back up the road from Grant Street to spend a couple of seasons in the Brora trophy cabinet. A Zander Sutherland goal in the opening 2 minutes as he and Steven Mackay gave the Nairn defence an early taste of their speed and trickery, a Richie Hart strike 15 minutes later, and Richie setting Martin Maclean up for one of his net bursting rockets on the hour mark in front of the delighted Brora support left The Wee County with no reply, and no cup.
