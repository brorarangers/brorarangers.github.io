Brora Rangers emerged victorious from a hard fought north derby against local rivals Wick Academy at 
Dudgeon Park to stay on the heels of league leaders Cove Rangers. 

Zander Sutherland came back into the Brora side after missing the win at Deveronvale on Saturday with player-manager Richie Brittain dropping himself to the bench as the only line-up change. 

Wick replaced Grant Campbell and Ross Allan with Alan Farquhar and Grant Steven. 

The opening 15 minutes were cagey and typical derby fare played mainly in midfield with both sides employing caution to avoid conceding early so there was no meaningful goalmouth action. A Gavin Morrison free kick for Brora was cleared and shortly afterwards a flick on from Steven MacKay didn’t come down quickly enough for Zander Sutherland to get a clean strike on target. Wick then had a good sweeping move ending in a left wing cross being headed over by Richard MacAdie who couldn’t rise quite high enough to direct his header. This was quickly followed by a right wing move.and cross that was cut out by Brora’s Ally MacDonald but the ball had marginally gone over the bye-line before the cutback.

The game was now opening up with both sides more willing to commit more men forward. Wick’s James Pickles got the first yellow card of the night for a foul on the halfway line as Brora broke quickly. Six minutes before the break, Brora were awarded a penalty after Wick full-back Michael Steven brought down Zander Sutherland inside the left edge of the box. After Saturday’s well-publicised penalty miss at Deveronvale, Steven MacKay passed on the penalty taking duty to Dale Gillespie who made no mistake with an emphatic drive into the roof of the net to open the scoring. 

A couple of minutes later, the champions doubled their lead with an incisive move and beautifully executed finish. Andrew Greig went on a trademark pacey run down the right wing and his enticing far post cross was met by Steven MacKay whose cushioned and controlled side-foot volley into the far corner of the net gave Wick keeper Sean MacCarthy no chance. Suddenly, in the space of a couple of minutes, an even contest swung into the control of Brora. Wick tried to respond immediately and a shot from the edge of the box was driven straight at Joe Malin so we went into the break with Brora holding a 2 goal cushion.   

Both sides started the second half playing a more open and expansive game with Brora continuing on the front foot as they had finished the first period, They almost went further ahead when another sweeping move again featuring Greig and MacKay, similar to the one for the second goal, ended with Wick keeper MacCarthy blocking well. 

Statistically, a 2-0 lead is the most vulnerable to hold as the team ahead mentally relax a little at the same time as the team in arrears step up their game in an extra effort to reduce the arrears and so it proved in the 65th minute. A slick Wick move down the right flank resulted in a dangerous, low cross into the Brora goalmouth. When the ball arrived at the far post, Brora’s defence got themselves into a right pickle (pardon the pun) when Brora’s full back John Pickles attempted clearance was collected by his elder brother James Pickles and dispatched in an instant into the roof of the net to halve the deficit.

However, Wick’s goal galvanised Brora as much as Wick and, after Gavin Morrison’s free kick narrowly wide of the near post, both Steven MacKay and Zander Sutherland had chances to extend the lead.  At the other end Grant Munro found his way into the referee’s book for a ‘professional’ foul on David Allan who otherwise would have been free on the edge of the box. Sam MacKay’s resultant powerful free kick was clawed away by Joe Malin. 

Shortly after Wick substituted Gary Manson for Richard MacAdie, Michael Steven was booked for felling Andrew Greig and Wick keeper Sean MacCarthy was relieved Zander Sutherland’s dipping cross shot from the right flank clear his crossbar. 

Brora sealed the win in the 79th minute with a beautiful flowing counter attack from the edge of their own box that was reminiscent of Arsenal at their imperious best. Andrew Greig collected the ball on the left side of his own box and played a delicious ball inside the Wick full back along the flank  to Zander Sutherland who started his run from just inside his own half. Sutherland advanced at pace and clipped an inch perfect  cross on the run into the path of the onrushing Dale Gillespie whose finishing touch saw the net bulge. The whole move took less than 10 seconds from start to finish and demonstrated the great quality and lethal finishing capability of the reigning champions.

Brora brought on Colin MacLean for Steven MacKay and Wick subbed their sub by bringing on Ross Allan for Gary Manson in the 90th minute but Brora held on comfortably for an important 3 points against a very tough opponent.

Richie Brittain was delighted with the performance. ‘There were great performances from all the players from the warm-up to the final whistle. We knew how Wick was going to play and we got a foothold in the game after 15 minutes.’ When I asked if he’d thought of bringing himself on, he replied, ‘not when the boys are playing like that. It was arguably the best performance of the season.’
