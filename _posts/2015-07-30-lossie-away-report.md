On an evening more resembling November than July, Brora Rangers started their campaign to retain their P&J Highland League title with a win at Lossiemouth on Wednesday.

Brora on the back of a sparkling display against Alloa, started the brighter and were well on top, taking a 0-2 lead into the half time break. 

Despite periods of pressure Brora only added one further score thanks to an own goal, but it was enough to secure the victory, and overall it was a comfortable victory for the Cattachs.

Brora took the lead in 7 minutes after Stuart Kettlewell took advantage of confusion in the Lossiemouth defence to slot home from close range.Captain Steven Mackay had to sit the game out due to being suspended, but his replacement Paul Brindle was sharp up front and doubled the advantage after good work from Scott Graham after 23 minutes. 

Despite a cohort of squandered chances and near misses Brora only made in 0-3 after a drive from Sutherland was turned into his own goal by Hector, passed his stranded goalkeeper.

Brora will need to be more clinical in front of goal as they progress their league campaign, but a win was most welcomed by players and travelling supported alike. 

Manager Ritchie Brittain was delighted with his teams endeavours and more importantly their start to the defence of their title.
