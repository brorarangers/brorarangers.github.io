Flaming June has arrived, which in Scottish football means it's time to consign many of the efforts of last season to the archives and get the ball rolling for 2017-18. It all starts here again in July.

Tokes has pretty much sorted out all the new signings at Brora Rangers (stay tuned this week for more news about that!), Sandy has been at his usual close season pitch preparation, the Board have been busy with strategies and budgets .... sometimes the few short weeks between lifting an end of season cup and kicking off the next season feel like the busiest of all.

Did we mention budgets? Aye, we all have them. You can barely switch the TV on, lift a newspaper, or peek online just now without some pre-election financial promises. So here's our money saving manifesto.

**Three pre-season games for £20.**

Our long time friends, **Inverness Caledonian Thistle** and **Ross County** are back at Dudgeon Park on the 4th and 12th July respectively, with 19:45 kick offs. **The Dons** come to town on Saturday 8th with a 3pm kick off. That's a whole lot of talent, determination and hope packed in to 3 games for your money.

Normal ticket prices will apply at the gate of £9, with £5 concessions ... or snap up your £20 deal by contacting Dale by [email](mailto:dale_john31@hotmail.com) or sending us a message on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brorarangersfc/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers)

Go on then, stop reading this, you've got less than a month to fix everything around the house, get the garden sorted, visit friends and family who don't understand the beautiful game, and even put your own feet up for a weekend. Time is short ... and we've a League to win. Don't forget the [overseas visits](http://brorarangers.football/2017/05/11/make-your-way-to-Stornoway/)

**The future is bright ... the future is still Red.**
