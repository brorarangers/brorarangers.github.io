Brora Rangers are absolutely delighted to confirm that James Ross has joined the club and signed a three year contract.

James spent last season with Ross County's development squad, gaining the Captain's armband. A popular youngster at Dudgeon Park, both as a player and as a loyal supporter, his return to Brora Rangers will be welcomed by all. Ross County's loss will definitely be our gain, not least in our upcoming IRN-BRU Cup game in early August.

Speaking on behalf of the Board, William Powrie said "We are thrilled to have acquired the services of James, who is such an exciting and talented young player."

James too was thrilled to be at Dudgeon Park and looking forward to the part he can play in assisting Brora Rangers regain the Highland League crown.
