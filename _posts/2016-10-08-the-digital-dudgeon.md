At the start of last season we made a commitment to improve the communication between the Club and our supporters.

Communication may not have been the best word, what we really want to create is a 'dialogue'.

Whilst a dialogue requires input from more than one party, we understood that someone needs to start the conversation, and so began a concerted effort to embrace the digital age and a new website.

This new website was launched back at the end of August last season, borne from a pre Scottish Cup discussion in a Dumfries hostelry and very much a toe in the water for a budding website developer. As far as putting a toe in the water it was a salutory lesson in testing the temperature with your elbow first. A good Football Club website has much to accomplish.

Our previous website platform did not allow us to measure how our supporters and other interested followers were engaging with us, but we can say that our first week of publishing news on our new website was viewed by 470 keen digital followers. By the end of the year we had managed to add another 2000 visitors to our weekly viewing figures. The digital ball was definitely rolling. Rolling and gathering pace to the extent that we received over 130,000 visits last season!

The increase in communication from the Club was further strengthened by our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brorarangers) account which ran a match day, blow by blow account for those who couldn't make the game as well as keeping followers up to date with Club news. All in all, we felt we were moving in the right direction.

The right direction is good ... but it also means change is inevitable. Not so long ago our aim was to dominate the Highland League, but change is inevitable. Our Manager came to Brora Rangers as part of a squad built to lead Highland League football, now he has been tasked with leading us into the SPFL Leagues. Our website developer and the Board wanted a website that would keep fans informed of Club news, now we have loftier ambitions. Our Digital Dudgeon had to grow.

We have a demanding team here at Dudgeon Park, the Board have a vision which they are not prepared to deviate from. Grant, Biscuits, Ally and Duffers won't accept second best, the squad only train to win, turn up to win, and accept no less than a win. Our Supporters Club, whilst being our strongest proponents, can be our fiercest critics. Our website developer fits the mould well, he believes we should be first with the news, he believes the current standard of football club websites is poor, and he believes that Brora Rangers Football Club can lead the pack.

So here we are, what looks like on the face of it as a new layout to our website, but what really is a kickstart to an exciting new Digital Dudgeon. If you go home today and tune in you'll find our latest news, results so far, and the remaining fixtures for the season. Tune in though, keep coming back, as we have big plans. Fancy a flutter on The Cattachs Lottery, come back soon, you can keep up to date with the latest draw, or if you are one of our far flung supporters, download a Standing Order form so you can be in it to win it, or at least support the Brora; wondering who our top scorer is, or how many clean sheets Joe and the back line have achieved? That will be up next. How old are the Lisle brothers? Who did Paul Brindle replace to score in the 86th minute? How many games has Lewis Grant appeared in? Stay tuned, it will all be on the website.

Football is like a website, results are everythng, entertainment is beguiling, working as a team is paramount, and as in the current climate in the Highland League, speed is becoming more and more important. If you want the technical details of how we made ourselves the fastest website in Scottish Football we'll have a news article to point you in the right direction soon, our developer is determined that we keep the crown of delivering the Brora Rangers news better than anywhere else.

That's the birth of our new website and our plans. That's the communication side of things almost taken care of. But as we said, communication was only half the aim. Dialogue is the plan, and that requires a whole new level of commitment from the Committee and Board ... and **you**.

Club Chairman, William Powrie, has led the way by creating a new 'hotline' for suggestions, comments, fund raising ideas and constructive criticism at [chairbrorarangers@btopenworld.com](mailto: chairbrorarangers@btopenworld.com). As William said,

>'Good ideas are not limited to the Board or Committee's and if you have one I'd dearly like you to let me know. I can't guarantee that it will be implemented, but I can guarantee it will be looked at.'
