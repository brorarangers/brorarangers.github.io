Make no mistake about it, this is an important meeting for both Clubs in the early rounds of the William Hill Scottish Cup.

Whilst both Brora and Clyde have their sights firmly set on their respective League titles and a chance of promotion this season, Cup runs generate much needed money to help achieve these aims.

We've met before in this competition, back in our 2013-14 inaugural Title winning season. By the time November the 2nd rolled around we were unbeaten in the League, we had the North of Scotland Cup sitting back in the trophy cabinet.

A late goal from Steven Mackay had finally broken the deadlock in our first round tie against Vale of Leithen in a match which saw 4 of the Vale squad and their manager sent for an early traipse up the tunnel.

Next out of the hat were Cove Rangers, the current Highland League champions but already faltering in their defence of the title. A 1-1 draw at Dudgeon Park led to a 0-3 victory for the Cattachs at Allan Park, with Zander, Sid and Martin all getting on the scoresheet.

Clyde, meanwhile, had cruised past Gala Fairydean in their 2nd Round tie with the same scoreline, and the draw on the 7th October saw us travelling down to Broadwood.

We were flying high, still unbeaten, seemingly unstoppable. Memories were still fresh of big Cup jaunts away to Edinburgh and Irvine. Great days out, but ultimately ending in defeat. This tie felt different. This was the 3rd Round. This was League 2 opposition. *This* was our moment.

The [BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24681564) pretty much covered the match blow by blow. To save you the click, a screamer from Zander saw the Cattach's take the lead after only 3 minutes and it looked like we were going to run the Bully Wee off the plastic pitch. 10 minutes later Clyde equalised and the game settled into a very equal and competitve match. In the 74th minute Kevin Watt put the home team into the driving seat and despite a frantic last 15, that it was. Our Cup run was over.

Confidence and self belief can work wonders for a football team. Confidence and self belief and a hunger to win. We had all that on our Broadwood visit, but as it turned out, it just wasn't quite enough. Perhaps there was a vital missing ingredient?

Experience?

Our starting line up back on the 2nd November 2013 was:

- Malin
- Hind
- D Mackay
- Morrison
- Munro
- Tokely
- Houston
- Hart
- S Mackay
- Sutherland
- Greig

Whilst there was obviously plenty experience of big games, big Cup games, in amongst our squad, this was our first season playing as a real title challenging squad. Indeed, our current manager had only arrived at the end of the previous month.

This time round we've picked up a fair bit experience of competing against SPFL opposition. We haven't done too badly. Room for improvement? Of course, isn't there always when you have ambition?

It's only 2 months since we went toe to toe with League 1 Peterhead. [They were impressed](http://www.peterheadfc.com/matches/item/1614-peterhead-progress-after-fighting-back-to-stun-brora), [we were disappointed](/2016/08/16/peterhead-away-report/). But we learn. That's experience.

We were on a fine run of form back in November 2014 when we headed down to Dumfries to meet Championship club, Queen of the South, in the 4th Round of this competition. Despite the final scoreline, we impressed enough down there for the Doonhamers to pay us many compliments and even send up a scouting party last season in the hope of a return match.

We're in a fine run of form again just now.

Make no mistake about it, this is another important meeting for both teams. But we've travelled further, and faced bigger and better, since November 2013. We've learned. We are still confident, we have the self belief, we definitely have the hunger. This time round we may just have added that missing ingredient.

Experience.

**We didn't come down the Clyde in a banana boat, but Clyde may just be heading to Brora for a banana skin.**
