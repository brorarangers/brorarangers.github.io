Few who attended our home game against Keith last season will forget the day ... though possibly more for the presentation of our League Trophy than our 2-0 victory.

Keith have had a promising start to the season with victories over Rothes and Buckie (though with less commanding scorelines than Brora have chalked up against the same opponents).

The Maroons come to Brora on the back of a 3-0 defeat to Cove Rangers and will no doubt be fired up for the second of three games on the trot against title contenders.

The weather forecast looks promising, so why don't you put a note in your diary and come to shout on The Cattachs as they continue their quest for a 3rd successive League title?
