Our match against Cove Rangers on Saturday 3rd December 2016 will be preceded by a minute's silence as a mark of respect for all those connected with Chapecoense FC.

There will be few fans of football around the world who have failed to be touched by the tragedy of LaMia Flight 2933 in Columbia on the 28th November. The Scottish Highland Football League have requested a minutes silence prior to kick off for all Saturday's matches.
