Once again Brora Rangers overcame a very heavy holding pitch  to thoroughly destroy Clachnacuddin in a display to rival that against Cove and Fraserburgh in previous weeks. Their 10-1 victory  was possibly their best performance of the season and has taken their goal tally to 99 for the campaign, and returned them to the head of the betting to lift the Highland League title.  

On a cold, wet and dark afternoon, Brora delivered a wonderful Christmas present for their band of travelling supporters, as they destroyed their Inverness opposition, with five wonderful goals in each half, with a display of passing and running football, which has become the trademark of the Cattachs play this season. 

A delighted Richard Brittain could not hide his joy at the end of the game. "We wanted to finish 2015 with performances we could be proud of, and we certainly have done that. We started the game with a focused game plan and we stuck to that throughout, and we will continue to do that. Our style of play brings all our players into moves, and you can see by the way that our goals are getting spread about that this approach is paying dividends. Dale Gillespie was brilliant today, and his hat-trick well taken and fully deserved. However all eleven players plus Steven Mackay and Lewis Grant who came on were utterly dominant and are delivering at the time of the season when it's needed"

It took Brora just 10 minutes to open the scoring when Andrew Greig beat  Callum Donaldson with a shot from the edge of the box, having left three defenders trailing in his wake.

Greig was instrumental in the second also, as it was he who crossed wide from the left flank to find Brindle unmarked and his header was beautifully placed wide of the Clachnacuddin keeper. Brindle could not hide his joy at the goal, as he celebrated on his knees in front of the Brora supporters behind the goal. He had attracted some fairly choice comments from the home supporters and he had delivered the perfect reply.

Gillespie and Morrison were dominant in midfield, and were both supported by Scott Graham who turned in a faultless performance. Indeed it was both Gillespie and Morrison that started the move which saw Zander Sutherland fire in number 3 from 20 yards. 

Brora were all dominant as the half began to draw to a close, but there was still plenty of time for Grant Munro to head in number 4 and Scott Graham to net a peach of a drive, which the Inverness stopper never even saw.

Clacnacuddin Manager Ian Polworth  clearly had a few choice words for his players during the break, as they did contest the first 20 minutes of the second half with a little more resolve, but their resistance was broken down in the 66th minute when Gillespie headed home following a free kick from Morrison. 

Blair Lawrie did manage to net for Clacnacuddin following a breakaway, but it did nothing to deter Brora from their relentless pressing and within 3 minutes Brora had scored again when Gillespie converted a penalty after Scott Graham was pulled back in the box. 

Steven Mackay had replaced Sutherland, and was already proving a real handful to the Lillywhite defenders, when he superbly latched onto a deep cross from Greig to hook the ball away from MacDonald and into the corner of the net.

Gillespie made it 9 and secured his hat-trick in 87 minutes with a thunderbolt from 35 yards and Greig made sure he topped and tailed the goal fest when he added number 10 in the last minute of the game. 

After a highly productive December, Brora Rangers now enter 2016 sitting at the head of the table, but Cove Rangers and Formartine United still have live chances for the title. However Brora Player Manager Richard Brittain can look back on 2015, knowing his team are where he would have hoped-top!
