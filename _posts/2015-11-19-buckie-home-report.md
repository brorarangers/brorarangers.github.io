Brora Rangers played their third home match in a week and turned in a very good performance to overcome Buckie Thistle in a game that featured the debut of their new signing from Fort William, John MacLeod who made a scoring start. MacLeod replaced Sid MacKay who was unavailable once again due to work commitments which was the only change in the Brora starting line-up. 


When asked why he made the move from the Fort, MacLeod replied, ‘It was hard to turn down. No disrespect to Fort William but when you get the chance to move to a top club and to play with players who played in the SPL you’ve got to take it although there was nothing wrong with the football Fort William played.’



Player manager Richie Brittain was delighted with the Cattachs’ performance. ‘We had a game plan – we knew how they would play and they played into our hands. We were absolutely phenomenal right from the warm up. We took a wee while to get going but then we dominated the game. It showed the character of Dale to take 3 penalties on the bounce and put them all away. With the state of the pitches just now and playing 3 games in a week, it’s good we’ve got a wee break coming up before we play at Keith.  



Buckie started with a 4-4-2 formation and this resulted in a brisk opening with the visitors looking for concerted attacking .moves rather than just to hit Brora on the break. Debutant John MacLeod was quickly into action in the 5th  minute with a drive that was tipped over the bar by Jag’s keeper Greig Sim and a couple of minutes later a shot from Buckie’s Kevin Fraser was held at the near post by Joe Malin following a corner conceded by an over hit back pass. This pattern of play continued with Brora having the bulk of the attacks but Buckie still tried to go forward when they could. 



Brora’s momentum resulted in them taking the lead after 35 minutes when Zander Sutherland was pushed in the box by Buckie defender Drew Copland and Dale Gillespie made no mistake from the spot. The champions had their tails up now and pushed forward with added gusto but in their eagerness to consolidate their lead they were caught offside several times – particularly John MacLeod’s runs into the box. The last threatening action of the half was when Andrew Greig blazed over the bar from the left edge of the box after a good knockdown by John MacLeod.

Buckie started the second half with the first attack when Lewis MacKinnon drove wide of the far post and shortly after Zander Sutherland was bundled over in the box again. It seemed another clear penalty but having given the first half penalty, the referee considered discretion to be the better part of valour and waved play on. Buckie went to the other end and once again Kevin Fraser unleashed a great drive that was parried away to safety by Joe Malin. 



Grant Munro had a shot held by Greig Sim on the line after a spell of Brora pressure and a few minutes later Lewis MacKinnon almost headed into his own net. However, a minute after this Martin MacLean fed John MacLeod with a through pass and the new boy drove it past the Buckie custodian to double the Cattachs’ lead. Zander Sutherland then hit the side netting on the right after latching on to a great through ball by Dale Gillespie.

On 69 minutes Sutherland was again taken down in the box, but again the referee played on. Sutherland seemed to be the victim of 3 clear penalties but only the first was given. Shortly after this, Buckie took off James Fraser and brought on Andrew Low. But it’s Brora who struck again. Once again, Martin MacLean was the provider and this time John MacLeod timed his run perfectly to run onto the pass and clipped a side footed effort inside the near post for 3-0. Brora were rampant now and John MacLeod was just a whisker away from getting a finishing touch on a left wing cross that ran along the goal line and another beautifully picked out through ball from Dale Gillespie left two Brora players to take their pick, but they left it to each other and the chance was gone. 



Buckie brought on Dennis Wyness and Robert Scott for Kia Ross and Stuart Taylor respectively with 10 minutes of normal time left and shortly after this Lewis MacKinnon had another 30 yard free kick pushed over the bar by Joe Malin. Having weathered that storm, Brora went up field and Ally MacDonald’s left wing cross appeared to be turned into his own net by Iain MacRae although John MacLeod may have got a final touch. Whoever is credited with the goal, Brora were 4-0 ahead and looking well worth their lead. 



In the last few minutes Brora substituted John MacLeod, Grant Munro and Andrew Greig ang gave a run out to Colin MacLean, Stuart Kettlewell and Lewis Grant. The action finished with Zander Sutherland firing across goal and over when it seemed easier to score and he again featured with a 35 yard drive that whistled over his former team Buckie’s bar. All in all, another good night’s work for the champions who took a maximum 9 points from their 3 home games in a week and showed they won’t relinquish their title easily.
