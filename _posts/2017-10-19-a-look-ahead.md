It has been a busy spell for all at Brora Rangers since the end of August with Scottish Cup, North of Scotland Cup and League fixtures all vying for their slot in the calendar.

As we pass the mid-way point of October and ready ourselves for the inevitable change in weather that accompanies the time of year, it feels like a suitable time to take stock and look at some of our upcoming fixtures before 2017 comes to an end.

We can take a short break from Cup competitions for a few weeks safe in the knowledge that comfortable victories over [Girvan FC](/2017/09/23/girvan-home-report/) and [Civil Service Strollers](/2017/10/14/strollers-away-report/) see us into the 3rd Round and a trip for our first meeting with Scottish League 1 side Stranraer on the 18th November.

Before that we have the [North of Scotland Cup Final](/2017/11/04/lossiemouth-final/) at Clachnacuddin's Grant St Park on the 4th November.

So it is League business that has our full attention for the remainder of the month.

The first third of our League campaign was completed with an exciting, end to end [Derby Day victory at Harmsworth Park](/2017/10/07/wick-away-report/) and this Saturday we move on to what promises to be another incredibly important fixture against [Formartine Utd](/2017/10/21/formartine-home/).

The Pitmedden Club sit only 3 points behind us after what sounded like a highly entertaining 3-4 victory over Rothes at Mackessack Park on Wednesday evening. Like ourselves they are still involved in the Scottish Cup after a 4-0 win over East Stirlingshire at the weekend earned them a home tie against Forfar Athletic in November. They too have their regional trophy Cup Final to look forward to, in the form of the Aberdeenshire Cup where they will battle yet again with Cove Rangers.

There would appear to be little to separate us at this stage, and it will surely be a matter of who wants the 3 points the most on Saturday afternoon that will determine the outcome of this game. Home advantage could be the deciding factor, especially if the home support display the passion shown in our last two matches.

Whatever the result, at full time we will be checking the SPFL League 1 results ... Stranraer v Raith Rovers should give us some indication of what we can expect come the 18th November given that we felt we conducted ourselves fairly well [against Raith in the Irn Bru Cup](/2017/08/15/raith-away-report/) back in August.

Wednesday evening sees us take the A96 to Keith's Kynoch Park. This is becoming a painful season for Keith FC, currently sitting 3rd from the bottom of the league table with their only league victory so far being a 2-1 win over Fort William.

Kynoch Park holds plenty of memories for us over the seasons, but [this SHFLtv video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVXo3MeVus8) has to be one of the happiest! Whilst it won't be a cause for Champagne on Wednesday 25th October, another 3 points is vital if we want to be celebrating at the end of the season.

It's back to home turf the following Saturday for our first meeting this season with Rothes and a change of dugout at the Dudgeon for Steven MacDonald.

Rothes have been on the end of some real spankings in recent years at Dudgeon Park ...

- November 2014: 6-0
- August 2015: 11-0
- August 2016: 5-0

But things have changed at Mackessack Park.

Rothes currently sit in 8th place in the League. With 19 points so far, that's only 2 wins and a draw behind where they finished at the end of last season, indeed, it is already 15 points ahead of where they finished in 2015-16. Spankings appear to be a thing of the past for The Speysiders, unless you want to count the one they handed out to Clachnacuddin at the start of September.

We certainly expect things to be a fair bit tighter and it could be the perfect game to enjoy one of our Hospitality Packages as we end the month and ready ourselves for a Cup Final in Inverness.

Talking of Match Day Hospitality, we've got some cracking fixtures coming up later in the year which would be perfect to make that little bit special with a group offriends, workmates or business associates.

The **16th of December** sees Fraserburgh come to town. The Broch have always been a team to push the league challengers, but this season they've taken that extra step and were only knocked off the top spot themselves after Cove's demolition of the current title holders.

Our festive home game is on **Saturday 30th December** against Deveronvale, ideal for those returning home for Christmas and New Year with family and friends.

It is Derby Day Part II on the **3rd February** and having [dealt with Wick Academy](/2017/10/07/wick-away-report/) at the start of the month this promises to be another fantastic fixture.
