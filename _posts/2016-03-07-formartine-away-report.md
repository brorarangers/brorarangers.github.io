Brora Rangers secured a home semi final tie against Cove Rangers in the Breedon Aggregates League Cup after an amazing game at North Lodge Park, where they emerged victors in a ten goal thriller, after the dreaded penalty shoot out. 

All 28 players who took part in the match, did themselves and their team proud, as too did the match officials who took a brave decision to play the match, despite a saturated and in parts waterlogged pitch. The elements did not relent throughout the game, with rain, sleet and snow and a barbarous northeast wind adding to the playing difficulties. 

Brora started the brighter and had the best of the early chances with Sutherland and Brindle both forcing saves from the Formartine keeper. 

Brora deservedly opened the scoring when Paul Brindle found himself in space and finished well, out of the reach of the exposed home keeper. 

Brora continued in the ascendancy,but it was Rodgers who levelled the scoring after a cross from the left was not dealt with and Rodgers headed in precisely. 

Brora were back in front within 5 minutes when Colin Williamson had a second bite of the cherry, and poked in from 15 yards. Their lead was further enhanced when Martin Maclean fired in after some excellent control, to send Brora into the half time interval well in control of the tie. 

The start of the second period saw the weather worsen and Formartine were spurred on by the strengthened wind at their back. The  next 20 minutes was probably the most bizarre and one sided that Brora have been involved in. The period saw Formartine totally dominate proceedings scoring 4 wonderful goals and had it not been for the brilliance of Joe Malin, they could have had another 6. 

The second half had barely started when Anderson headed in for Formartine's second, and within 3 minutes the scores were level, when, that man Gary Wood converted after good work from Anderson. 

The Brora midfield had gone missing as Formartine surged forward in waves and within a minute of equalising had taken the lead after Lawson about broke the net with a screamer into the postage stamp corner of goal from well outside the penalty box. 

The surge from the Aberdeenshire outfit was not over, as Barbour made it 5 for the home side to send the their supporters into delight and rapture. 

As events were to prove, their euphoria was to be misplaced as Brora picked themselves up from the swampy floor and begin a fightback which would catapult the game into the annals of club history. 

Before home supporters celebrations had died down after their fifth, Brora got themselves back into the game, when substitute Andrew Greig pulled one back after some brilliant individual work on the wing, cutting in and firing home over the beaten Formartine keeper. 

Every single Brora player was now summoning up unknown deep reserves of energy as Formartine were beginning to run on empty. Andrew Greig's fresh legs gave Brora real width and they began to re-probe the Formartine defence. 

In 75 minutes Brindle really should have levelled the tie when he outran his marker but miscued his shot badly. 

With the clock ticking down Andrew Greig won a corner after some clever work on the wing. It was "Man the Pumps" from the Formartine players as all their 11 players were back in their penalty box, as too was Joe Malin, as the Brora keeper arrived in unchartered waters. 

Right to script, Formartine failed to clear their lines, and Colin Williamson was on hand to rifle the ball home to rescue the tie for Brora. 

There was still another drama to be played out, as turning to run back to his own goal, Joe Malin twisted his knee and incurred an injury which was to see him replaced early in extra time. 

After 93 amazing minutes referee Thomas Shaw brought this most compelling of ties to a close and subject the twenty-two players to another gruelling 30 minutes of herculean effort. 

Within 5 minutes of the start of the extra period it was evident that Joe Malin could no longer continue and Richard Brittain had to make emergency changes. John Macleod was marshalled in between the sticks as Brora were reduced to ten men. 

Momentum once again swung to the home side as they attempted to make the most of their numerical advantage, but despite having 70% of possession they failed to test John Macleod once, with their only three shots of extra time, sailing harmlessly over the bar. 

The Brora midfield and defence were simply superb during the extra period of play, with Colin Williamson and Grant Munro magnificent in their resolve not to let anything pass. Morrison, Maclean and Gillespie never stopped running whilst Greig was clever enough to hold the ball up, and give the Brora rear guard a respite. 

Formartine felt they should have been awarded a penalty when the ball struck John Pickles hand, but referee Shaw adjudged it was ball to hand, and called the decision absolutely correctly. 

After 30 minutes of added time, no additional scoring was added and 120 minutes of amazing football was brought to an end, with every player utterly exhausted, having given their all. 

In a fitting finale to this dramatic script, John Macleod saved Formartine's fourth penalty, leaving Dale Gillespie to step up to the plate and calmly stroke Brora Rangers into the semi-final.
