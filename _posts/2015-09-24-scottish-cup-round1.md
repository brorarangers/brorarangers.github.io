The Cattach's non football following family and friends have a special weekend coming up. It's the first round of the William Hill Scottish Cup and Brora Rangers need not apply. Thanks to our League Championship last season, and Turriff Utd's second spot, neither Club get involved until the Second Round on the 24th October.

Cove Rangers have already seen off Golspie Sutherland and St Cuthberts Wanderers to make it into this weekend's games, along with all the rest of our Highland League neighbours.

The all Highland League clashes of Buckie Thistle vs Rothes, Keith vs Inverurie Locos, Deveronvale vs Clachnacuddin and Lossiemouth vs Forres Mechanics could all be closely contested games.

Cove have also drawn 'weel kent' opponents in Banks o' Dee. As for the rest, it's the real excitement of the Cup.

Strathspey Thistle vs Edinburgh University, Nairn County vs Selkirk, Fraserburgh vs Dalbeattie Star, Wick Academy vs Whitehill Welfare and Formartine Utd vs Gretna 2008 give great hope to our neighbours. Who doesn't like getting that initial home draw to get the ball rolling and increase the chances of progressing into the next round?

Fort William provide their supporters with a 150 mile trip south and east to meet Preston Athletic. Huntly have to make a 220 mile journey to the mid table East of Scotland League's Hawick Royal Albert.

You can keep up with our Highland League hopefuls on the [SFA Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/scottishfa) or follow the [#DefyTheOdds](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DefyTheOdds&src=typd) hashtag. The Scottish Cup even has it's own [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/scottishcup) page. Once again there is also the official [Scottish Cup YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ScottishCupOfficial) channel to catch up on every goal scored.

So there's plenty of action for us to keep an eye on whilst waiting for our next game against Turriff Utd on the 3rd October. Some of our neighbours are going to have to #DefyTheOdds to make it through to Round 2, but that's the magic of the Cup. All the very best to all those teams representing the Highland League on Saturday afternoon.
