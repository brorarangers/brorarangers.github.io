Brora Rangers are delighted to announce two additions to their coaching staff to assist Grant Munro and Steven MacDonald.

Former Deveronvale Manager Ally Macleod joins the Cattachs alongside the well "kent" face of Alan Duff. The addition of these two experienced heads will add greatly to the support team in the dugout and set Brora up to win.

Team Manager Grant Munro introduced the pair at training on Monday evening and the role both will play.

Speaking on behalf of the Board William Powrie welcomed the pair to the club and acknowledged the contribution which both will make going forward.
