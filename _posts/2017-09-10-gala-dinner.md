The Annual Gala dinner of Brora Rangers took place at the Kingsmills Hotel on Friday 8th September and it was the biggest and best yet.

At a time when it is becoming increasing difficult to host such large fundraising events, David Dowling and his team bucked the trend and put on an evening to remember.

The evening was again hosted by the energetic and enthusiastic Iain Thain and the guest speaker ex Referee and Solicitor Willie Young was amusing and entertaining. Again Torridon rocked the hall until the early hours of the morning.

The Club are very grateful to all those  companies and individuals who provided such a wonderful selection of auction items and raffle prizes. We are equally grateful to all those who paid so generously in the auctions and raffles, and their contributions play a very important part in the running of the football club.

Finally, again a huge thank you to the Kingsmills Hotel for laying on such a wonderful meal and looking after everybody so very well.
