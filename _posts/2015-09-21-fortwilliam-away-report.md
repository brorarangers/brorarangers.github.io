On the very small Fort William pitch, the home side started in a terrier like manner and made life difficult for the Brora passing game. 

First chance of the game fell to the home side, but Macleod's shot went narrowly passed Malin's far post. 

Brora gradually gained control of the middle of the park and fully deserved their lead as Brindle put the Cattachs one up. 

Steven Mackay headed home the second and it was Brindle again who added the third before the interval. 

Brora started the second half brightly but were caught by a Fort William break away and Macleod scored a superb goal passed Malin who had no chance. No sooner had the crowd recovered its breath at that goal, then that man Macleod was on hand and netted Fort Williams second with another contender for goal of the season. 

It was "man the pumps" for Brora who had seen the game totally turn around, but gradually they regained the upper hand and it was Brora's man of the match Grant Munro who added a fourth. Paul Brindle added the fifth and secured his second hat-trick of the season. 

The action was far from over as Macleod launched a screamer and notched his first hat-trick of the season. 

Despite time running out Fort William should have added a fourth, but this time Macleod saw his penalty well saved by Joe Malin, low to his right. 

A  comfortable enough win for Brora, but they will have to concentrate on closing games out, as Fort William very nearly caused an upset.
