Following the success of our previous year's Golf Day, we are delighted to announce that another one has been arranged for Friday 6th May.

You can enter a team of four for the fantastic price of £260.00. For members of Brora Golf Club a special entry fee of £160.00 per team has been negotiated. This price includes bacon rolls on arrival at 12.30 and a three course dinner followed by prize giving after the competition.

The top 3 teams will all receive a prize, with vouchers worth £75.00 for all members of the winning team.

The competition takes the form of a Texas Scramble with a shotgun start at 1.30pm.

Following feedback from previous events there is no after dinner speaker due to the late finish and allowing for travelling time.

You can book your place through our [Secretary](mailto:brorarangersfc@highlandleague.com) or through any of our Committee and Board members.

Brora is a wonderful links course that's always in excellent condition, so book now to enjoy a great day out.
