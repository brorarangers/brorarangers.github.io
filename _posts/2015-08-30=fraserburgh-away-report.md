Brora Rangers resumed winning ways as they ran out very comfortable victors against a busy Fraserburgh outfit at Bellslea Park yesterday. 

Brora started with a different looking line up with Brindle, Graham and Brittain all starting the game. 

The small narrow pitch once again did not suit our preferred style of wide play, but unlike against Cove last week, we adapted our game to great effect with Morrison and Gillespie quickly taking control of midfield operations. 

Grant Munro had to leave the field midway through the first half with a very nasty cut over his eye after a clash of heads. Martin Maclean came on with Gillespie dropping back into the back line. 

Despite having the vast majority of possession in the first half Brora squandered many scoring opportunities and peppered the Fraserburgh woodwork. However with the break approaching Brora were awarded a penalty and Richard Brittain slotted the ball home past the home keeper. 

Brora resumed in determined fashion and immediately pushed Fraserburgh back onto the defence. Red waves of attacks followed and Brindle scored the second after a  good flowing move. 

Brora were comfortably in command and with a bit of better finishing could have added another four or five, but a combination of great saves,the woodwork and some careless finishing kept the tally at just two. At the other end Fraserburgh created little bar a curling goal bound shot which produced an exceptional save from Malin. 

The last five minutes saw Fraserburgh mount a final push, having pulled back a goal, after the linesman judged the ball to have crossed Malins line. However the Brora defence were comfortably in control and the Cattachs returned north to Sutherland with all three points.
