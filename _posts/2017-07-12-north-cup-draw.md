We will commence the defence of our North of Scotland Cup on 23rd August with a home tie against Inverness Clachnacuddin.

If successful we will travel to Nairn County in the second round. Subsequent rounds will be open and not regionalised.

Also in the opening round, Invergordon will travel to Wick Academy, Forres welcome Rothes and last season's runners up, Fort William, will host Elgin City.

Golspie Sutherland, Nairn County, Lossiemouth and Strathspey Thistle all receive a bye into the second round which is due to be played on the 6th September.
