og-description: Brora Rangers Football Club are making inroads into a digital revolution to match their onfield ambitions
---
The club are very anxious to communicate better with our supporters whether they are regulars at the matches or support Brora Rangers from afar.

We have for sometime now felt our current Website and Programme are not sufficient for a club whose ambitions are to progress into the SPFL. If we are serious about our ambitions we must begin to get our off field operations into line with what would be expected at a higher level.

We are currently reviewing all our communication channels and listening to what our supporters are saying.

We have looked at our website options and will be moving away from our current platform and running our own website. This will allow us to have a far more relevant medium and be able to be quicker in bringing club news to our supporters.

The website will also act as a reference site for all things Brora Rangers and will promote those local and national businesses that currently support and sponsor us.

For now we will continue to update the news and fixture feeds on this current platform but hopefully this should only be for a short period of time

We have also taken the opportunity to review our match day programme offering. The existing programme needs to be updated and contain far more information and provide our own and those visiting supporters with a match day read.

We have over the last couple of home games handed out match day team sheets which have been well received,

It's our intention to hopefully have a version 1 of our new programme ready for our home match against Rothes on Saturday. This however will be work in progress as it will take a couple of weeks to complete the project.
