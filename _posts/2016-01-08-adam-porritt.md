Brora Rangers confirmed today that their young defender Adam Porritt has signed for Fort William FC.

Adam joined us at the start of last season, but due to an injury in one of his first games for the Club was unable to play for the remainder of the 2014/15 season. Whilst unable to get a start this season, Adam has been on the Brora bench 15 times in our defence of the League Championship.

Everyone at Brora Rangers wishes Adam all the very best at Claggan Park and hope to see him progress as he gets the opportunity for more game time.
