A wet but incredibly mild Christie Park saw a very hard working Huntly side put plenty of pressure on the reigning champions on Wednesday night.

Zander Sutherland opened the scoring in the 7th minute, giving the travelling Brora support high hopes of a repeat of the 0-8 scoreline from this fixture last season. Gregg Carol's lads had a different game plan though. Alex Thoirs rewarded Huntly's determination with a well taken equaliser just two minutes later.

Brora's lead was restored very soon afterwards by that man Brindle again in the 12th minute smartly peeling away from the Huntly defence to place a well controlled header into the back of the net.

Brora continued to dominate the game, but with chances going a begging and Huntly looking dangerous on the break there was an air of inevitability about David Booth's equaliser in the 67th minute. 

Brora upped the tempo in an effort to regain the lead, but time really appeared to be running out for the reds, until Andrew Greig popped up in the 88th minute to rattle the ball off the underside of the crossbar and over the line.

Anyone with any doubts about how important the 3 points were to the players would only need a brief glimpse of the celebrations following the goal, celebrations mirrored by the dozen or so Cattach's who had travelled to back their team. As the competitors for this season's league championship continue to grind out points this could prove to be a very important result for the defending champs.
