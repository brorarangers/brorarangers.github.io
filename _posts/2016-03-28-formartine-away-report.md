If Brora Rangers fail to retain their Highland League title it will not be through the result at North Lodge Park, where they fought out a riveting 3-3 draw with fellow title contenders Formartine United. 

Certainly the fixture drew the attention of many neutrals from far and wide and they swelled a crowd of well in excess of 500. The North Lodge officials were swift to open an additional turnstile, and people were still entering the ground well after the match had started.

The cohort of Cattach fans did their bit to add to the occasion with over 100 travelling to Aberdeenshire to cheer their team on. 

John Macleod was still absent from the Brora squad due to illness and Steve Martin retained his place in goal as Joe Malin has not recovered from his knee injury. 

The weather was far from spring like, as a cold blustery wind and a persistent rain kept Easter bunnies well snuggled up in their burrows. 

The first five minutes of the first half probably were shaded by Brora, but this was to be as good as it got for them as a strong physical Formartine team were to totally dominate the remainder of the half and deservedly go in 2-0 at the break and in a very comfortable position. 

Formartine opened the scoring after 20 minutes when Barbour fired in from 8 yards after two fine double saves from Steve Martin in the Brora goal. Martin  got down well to save two close range attempts, but after each save the Brora defence failed to deal with the rebounded ball and Barbour made no mistake with the third effort. 

Brora were very nearly back on terms after a vicious 35 yard curling dipping shot from Martin Maclean beat the Formartine keeper, but only to strike the crossbar. 

Whilst the Brora front line of Greig, Brindle and Sutherland were busy, they were seeing very little of the ball, as the Formartine defence easily mopped up the high balls which were being punted upfield by a beleaguered Brora defence. 

With the Brora midfield being bypassed, nobody from the Cattachs were able to put their foot on the ball and slow things down, and as a result Formartine were sending waves of attacks down the field and Brora were forced to almost continually defend. 

With such a siege on the visitors goal, it was only a matter of time before Formartine would double their advantage, and indeed they did so after 30 minutes when Scott Barbour blasted the ball past Martin from 7 yards, after a fatal mistake from the usually reliable Scotty Houston. A simple cross ball from the left was not dealt with by the Brora defence and Houston appeared to miscue his clearance, only to leave it on a plate for a surprised Graeme Rodger to accept the gift graciously, leaving Martin with absolutely no chance in the goal to even smell the drive as it flew into the net. 

To be fair, the remaining 15 minutes of the half, saw Brora tighten up considerably as they started to play the ball on the ground and managed to keep the hosts down to 2 goals, and give themselves an opportunity to regroup at the interval. 

Just as Formartine did to Brora in the Breedon Aggregates Cup a month earlier, Brora started the second half with a totally different mindset, and were to deliver a performance of immense desire and courage, and against all the odds transform the outcome of the match. 

Manager Richard Brittain took off Houston and replaced him with Pickles who played at right back with Colin Williamson slipping into the centre back role. 

Man of the match Pickles transformed the whole shape and play of Brora, and for 45 minutes ran the left side of the Formartine defence ragged and they had no answer to his rapier like pace and positional play and gave Brora a new dimension to their game. No more aimless punts up front, but sweet determined passes and plenty running off the ball, giving the man in possession plenty of options. 

Pickles was not alone in raising the standard. Andrew Greig was skinning the right back at will, and between these two, Formartine were forced back into almost constant defence. 

It was no surprise at all when Brora pulled one back, through Grant Munro who was also having a wonderful game. Pickles won a corner on the right, and a perfect delivery from Sutherland saw Grant Munro head home a well deserved score.

No respite for Formartine as immediately from the restart Morrison won the ball and sent a beautiful ball over the defence for Greig to run on to. His jinking run and cross found Brindle in the centre but his goal was ruled out through offside. 

No stopping the surge of the black and white clad Cattachs as both Pickles and Greig were in their pomp, and it came as no surprise when the equaliser arrived. Again great work on the left by Greig saw his cross find an unmarked Zander Sutherland who converted the opportunity and put the Sutherland champions back on terms.

One way traffic now, and Brora almost took the lead when a Gillespie low drive through a forest of defenders just went wide with the keeper grounded at the other side of the goal. Maclean also had another great effort strike the upright when it was looking destined for success. 

Brora should have been awarded a penalty when a Pickles curling cross caused utter chaos in front of the Formartine goal, and Munro clearly used his outstretched hand to control the ball before his panicked clearance. 

Against the run of play, and on a rare trip upfield Formartine took the lead. From a throw on the right, a cross in was met by Gary Wood who sent a looping header over Martin 

Steven Mackay who had replaced Dale Gillespie, was making his presence felt up front and was winning many balls in the air, and linking up with Greig out wide, and with 15 minutes remaining it was Mackay who got Brora's third, reacting first to a bouncing ball close to the goal and poking it home.

The last 10 minutes of the game saw a tense affair with Brora in the ascendency and could well have secured it deep into stoppage time. Awarded a free kick on the edge of the box, Gavin Morrisons free kick was cleared by the Formartine wall, and referee Graham Fraser brought a hum-dinger of a game to a close. 

Whilst both teams really needed a victory, the neutrals left North Lodge Park waxing lyrical about the game, and every Brora player can hold their heads high on the back of a display which will live long in the memory of those lucky enough to have been there.
