Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the signing of Alan Pollock from Nairn County.

Club Chairman William Powrie signed Alan when he visited his new team mates during training at Alness on Thursday evening. Alan was recently married and has literally just returned from honeymoon.

Speaking on behalf of the club William Powrie commented, "We are delighted to welcome Alan to the club. He is one of several targets we have been tracking, and he will strengthen our squad as we prepare for the season ahead. He was outstanding against us last season and was on our radar immediately following our cup win against Nairn."
