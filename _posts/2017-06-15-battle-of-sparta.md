Legend has it the Spartans won their greatest victory in August of 480BC. The Spartans FC, however, have been winning some other accolades in far more recent history.

The Club won the inaugural Lowland League title in 2013-14 and were highly hopeful of becoming the first Lowland League side to make it into the first Pyramid Playoff to meet the winners of the Highland League the following season.

They missed out on the chance to meet us in the playoff that season thanks to the efforts of neighbours Edinburgh City.  This season? Who knows? We will definitely both be doing our best to make that happen this time round,

Which makes the last of our pre-season matches all the more interesting.

After a run of home games against higher League competition, (you have bought your [Season Ticket Taster](/2017/06/05/season-ticket-taster/)?) we head down to Edinburgh for the perfect test before our season begins in earnest.

**The Spartans v Brora Rangers, 22nd July 2017, Ainslie Park, Edinburgh.**
