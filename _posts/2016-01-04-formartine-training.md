Brora had a high tempo and technical training session at Victoria Park Dingwall on Monday evening.

Despite the disappointment of the Nairn County defeat, the squad were in a highly positive mood, prior to the big game on Saturday. It was good to see Colin Williamson back and all players looked sharp and keen.
