Brora meet Clachnacuddin FC at Grant Street Park on Boxing Day for the first of our festive fixtures, and our last game of 2015.

The Inverness pitch has been a happy hunting ground for Brora over the past few seasons, with 2 league victories and 2 North of Scotland Cup Final wins since our last defeat there in January 2013.

It's fair to say Clach aren't having the best of seasons, and come into this game needing to recapture the form they had through October and the start of November when they managed to record a 2-2 draw against Formartine and a 2-1 victory over Inverurie, along with victories over Strathspey, Huntly and Fort William.

Brora Rangers appear unstoppable just now.  12 league wins on the trot, undefeated in the League for 14 games, and a 6-0 demolition of 8th place Fraserburgh last Saturday.

It's still as tight as ever at the top of the table, where Cove play their last game of the year on Sunday 27th at Fraserburgh's Bellslea Park, and Formartine take on Buckie Thistle at home on Monday 28th. On paper that suggests no real change in the fight for first place as we enter 2016. But this is football, and it doesn't always work out as expected.

The Supporters' Club have organised a bus for this game, and it's filling up quickly. Book your seat through our Supporters Club Facebook page or get in touch through our [email address here](mailto:brorarangers@gmail.com) ... £20 for members and £23 for non-members. 

It's the holidays, and it certainly beats the Boxing Day Sales crush. 

See you there!
