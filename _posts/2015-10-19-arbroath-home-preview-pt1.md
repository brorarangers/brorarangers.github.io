Saturday sees Brora open their 2015/16 William Hill Scottish Cup campaign at Dudgeon Park against an Arbroath side who have improved greatly after a sticky start to their season.

Four wins from their last five games still sees them sitting third from bottom in the League Two table, but wins against East Fife, Stirling, East Stirlingshire and Montrose, marred only by a 2 goal defeat to table topping Annan Athletic, shows that confidence will be high amongst the Red Lichties.

Bobby Linn has played no small part in the recent resurgence of the Angus club, and was voted the Ladbrokes League 2 Player of the Month for September, though his goal tally of 5 for the season so far is unlikely to impress our own Paul Brindle and Steven Mackay. Perhaps of more concern is the 3 clean sheets in their last four victories, though the recent form of the Cattach's should prevent another one on Saturday.

Also worthy of note is Arbroath's habit of scoring in the last 15 minutes, so concentration to the bitter end will be vital.

Last season Arbroath made it through to the fifth round of the Scottish Cup, beating Nairn 2-1 on the way and finally losing out 3-1 at Easter Road to the Hibs side that were narrowly defeated by Falkirk in the semi final.

That's enough about the opposition ... there's no need to mention the [Arbroath v Bon Accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbroath_36%E2%80%930_Bon_Accord) match every time, that was 130 years ago. I've checked, even the Auldies deny being at the game. This week we're only interested in who can Defy the Odds.

Brora vs Arbroath ... Part 1 suggests there's more to come. There is, it's Scottish Cup weekend, let's make the most of it and get right behind the lads this weekend. COYR!
