It seems like a long, long time since we travelled to Christie Park on a dark, wet Wednesday night to face a determined Huntly. To be honest, it even seems like a lifetime away that we [reviewed our season so far](/2015/12/31/hogmanay-review-3.html) on the last day of 2015.

Our Hogmanay article described the attitude of the squad at that game as a turning point. Their fighting spirit and never say die display was a talking point amongst many of the Brora support. Little did we realise then just how crucial that refusal to accept a game is over until the final whistle is blown would be as March 2016 rolled around. The photo above could be titled *'The Agony and the Ecstasy'*. It's been a familiar emotion over the past weeks.

Our 2-3 away victory over Huntly in October kicked off a 13 game winning streak for the Cattachs in the League. Huntly didn't win in the League in their next 12 matches.

That's football for you, the Agony and the Ecstasy. Mark Gray and Douglas Baxter have masterminded a Huntly resurgance this March. A 2-2 draw against 7th placed Nairn County, another 2-2 draw against 8th place Fraserburgh, a 3-1 victory over 12th place Lossiemouth and this season's obligatory victory at Rothes. Much as they did against us on that wet Wednesday in October, Huntly FC are paying scant regard to League positions just now.

If it's a battling team you want though, best turn your attention back to Brora Rangers. There have been twists and turns, there are no doubt twists and turns to come. 

This month we've squared up to the League challengers 3 times. This month has pretty effectively demonstrated just how closely matched the top 3 teams are this season. These games have eclipsed the Christie Park performance when it comes to a squad of players who refuse to give up. Refuse to give up on an opportunity. Refuse to give up on a match. Refuse to give up on a third League title.

Given the backing our travelling support have provided as we head in to each and every crucial match, it's not just the manager and players who are refusing to let the title dream slip away just yet.

Wednesday evening is our penultimate home game of the Highland League 2015/16 season. Huntly won't be coming along just to make up the numbers when we kick off at 8pm, the 12th Man effect has been very much in evidence during March, especially as we progressed to next month's Highland League Cup final. As we said before last Saturday's big game ...

### *"get right behind the lads again and help drive us on to victory"*
