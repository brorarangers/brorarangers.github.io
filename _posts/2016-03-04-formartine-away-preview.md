Beaten by the weather last weekend, it's back to the Breedon Aggregates Highland League Cup duty for Brora Rangers again on the 5th March.

That was the scene in Pitmedden last weekend, and with League fixtures beginning to mount up due to the less than favourable weather conditions that 2016 has provided for Highland League football so far, both side will be keeping everything crossed that this match can go ahead.

The winner of this game will meet Cove Rangers at home in the semi final, whilst the winner of this weekend's other quarter final at Grant Street Park between Clachnacuddin and Nairn County will face Turriff Utd. Both semi finals are currently scheduled to be played on Saturday 12th March.

There is still some space on the Supporters bus leaving for Pitmedden around 10am on Saturday morning, [get in touch](mailto: brorarangers@gmail.com) if you fancy the prospect of a great day out and a fiercely contested match.
