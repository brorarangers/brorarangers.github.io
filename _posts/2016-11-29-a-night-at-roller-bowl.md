With the mercury plummeting on Monday, the Management and players decamped to Roller Bowl in Inverness for an evening with a different set of balls!

Prior to the big game on Saturday against Cove Rangers, it was felt important to bring the squad together and with 21 attendees it proved to be a cracking evening and thoroughly enjoyed by all.

The competition was played with 4 lanes of five players and the top six going forward to the "grande finale"

Perhaps with the exception of Cammy, who was doing his best to imitate Darcy Bussell, our normally target focused front line were......pretty useless. Top strikers Brindle and Steven Ross, regularly missed the pins all together, with Steven taking 3 deliveries, to knock his first skittle over.

After four exciting qualifying rounds the top six scores were;

- Jamie Duff 159
- Alan Pollock 156
- Colin Williamson 136
- Craig Campbell 126
- Steven MacDonald 121
- Ally MacDonald 120

Out with the washing;

- Steven Ross 62
- Gavin Morrison 70
- Daniel Cormack 75
- Digger 85

The final was a much more skilled affair with Biscuits, Pollock, Ally MacDonald and Jamie Duff all securing double/triple strikes. Colin by the end was struggling to see the end of the alley, and was sending down his deliveries before the machine had even set the skittles back up!
However it was the old fox, Biscuits, who really got his game together and ran out a comfortable winner with 186, followed by Ally MacDonald 135, Jamie Duff 126, Cammy 116 , Alan Pollock 110 and Colin Williamson 110  

Back to footballs on Thursday night as Grant and the team put in place  their match plans for Saturday.
