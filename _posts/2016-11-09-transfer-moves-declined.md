The Board at Brora Rangers have declined a revised offer for Steven Mackay from Cove Rangers, and have also not accepted a transfer request from Andrew Greig.

The transfer of Steven is not about money, far from it, but an obligation on behalf of the Board to make decisions in the best interests of Brora Rangers. At this particular time there is an understandable reticence to allow a player of Steven’s calibre to move to a principal competitor club.

The Board also declined a transfer request from Andrew Greig, made two weeks ago. Andrew is viewed as a key member of the team squad going forward and will remain at Dudgeon Park.

Speaking on behalf of the Board. Club Chairman William Powrie commented, “Steven has made great contributions to the club and we saw on Saturday just how good a player he remains. Given that we are now entering the business end of the season, it would remiss of us to release him to a club such as Cove Rangers who are chasing down the same Press & Journal league title as we are. Likewise with Andrew Greig, the Board could not accept his request to be placed on the transfer market. Chubbs has found it difficult to command a regular place in the starting line up, but he is a class player, and an undoubted match winner. We have every confidence  Andrew will refocus his efforts and will continue to be a key member of the Cattachs”.
