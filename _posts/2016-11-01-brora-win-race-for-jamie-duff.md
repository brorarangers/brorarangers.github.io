Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the signing of Jamie Duff from Elgin City for an undisclosed fee.

Jamie (27) brings a host of experience to Dudgeon Park. He has enjoyed Premier League experience with Inverness Caledonian Thistle prior to a lengthy knee injury which resulted in an enforced absence. He resumed his career at Elgin City where he captained the side for several seasons.
 
Club Chairman William Powrie was absolutely delighted to secure Jamie’s signature ahead of the several other principal Highland League Clubs that were actively chasing him down. “As we approach the midpoint of the season, the Board felt that in order to strengthen our challenge for the league title, we needed to bring in a defender of the calibre of Jamie, the likes of which are rarely available.”
 
Current central defender Ross Tokley is once again on his travels with work, and this is a situation which may repeat itself. Grant Munro continues to carry a few niggles, so Jamie has been brought in to add strength in depth to the Cattachs defence. At 6' 1" he has a commanding physical presence and will signal loud and clear the ambitions of the Club.
 
We have recently added Steven Ross to our squad and with his 4 goal haul on Saturday is already beginning to pay back the Club’s investment. Likewise Scott Lisle, Cameron Lisle and James Ross are illustrative of our willingness to build for the future through youth also.
 
Jamie who represented Scotland at Under 21 level against Northern Ireland in 2008, will be included in the Brora Rangers squad to play Strathspey Thistle on Saturday at Grantown on Spey.   
 
Manager Grant Munro is delighted Duff will be joining his squad. “I’ve known Jamie for many years and he is a talented gifted player who has recovered well from a serious injury and is a player of absolute quality. I recommended him to my Board and they have invested wisely, and I’m sure Jamie going forward will play a huge part in the successes of this club”.
