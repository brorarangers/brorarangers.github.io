Brora Rangers Football Club will hold their Annual General Meeting at 7pm on Tuesday 25th October.

When we announced the launch of our [new website](/2016/10/08/the-digital-dudgeon/) last week we stressed it was part of our aim to create a dialogue between the Club and our supporters. The website is pretty much one way traffic, a conduit for us to give information to you. Over the next few weeks we'll be developing our Facebook presence which allows those already part of the social media platform an easier channel to comment on Club matters.

The Annual General Meeting, to be held in the Social Club, is a far more direct and effective way for us to come together to share views and ideas though.

The Meeting will take the usual format of our Annual Report followed by an open Q&A session. It's an opportunity to put your views and questions to the Club. It's the Club's opportunity to put our views and questions to you, the Supporters. These types of discussions can often throw up ideas that can help Brora Rangers meet the constant challenges of running a football club.

Tuesday 25th October, 7pm, in the Brora Rangers Social Club. Please come along, get involved, and join the dialogue.
