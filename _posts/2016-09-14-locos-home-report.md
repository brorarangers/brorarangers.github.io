This was Inverurie Locos second visit to the Far North on consecutive Saturdays and, just like at Wick, they came away from Brora with a creditable point. 

The Harlaw Park side frustrated the free-scoring Cattachs for long periods of the game and, for all their pressure and possession, the home side found it very difficult to break down the Locos’ well-organised defence and create clear-cut scoring chances.

Inverurie’s co-manager Scott Buchan was pleased with his side’s overall performance. ”It’s a point gained for us. You could say we should have saved the game but Brora are a good team. They came at us and came at us and the referee gave them a helping hand; that was a poor decision (the Brora penalty). He hadhis hand by his side and you cannot possibly get your hand away in that situation. 

Their second goal was a great goal and we were hanging on a bit at the end. We were pleased the way we contained them so there’s a lot of positives we take away from the game.”

Brora’s player-manager Grant Munro was a lot less pleased. “To get a draw was good for us as we were very poor all over the park and to draw after being two up must feel like a defeat for them. This performance was very disappointing after two good performances in our previous games so by previous standards we’ve let ourselves down today. Having said that, I was pleased with the boys keeping on going to the end and getting their reward of a draw. Like most teams coming here they made it difficult for us by playing 5 at the back and with Joe making that uncharacteristic mistake and gifting them a goal it gave them a lift and they were happy to sit in. Their big boys played well and we lost our shape but we dug in. 

The second goal was also a poor one to give away and the only positive to take from the game is that we got a point. We’ll take our medicine and move on and look forward to the big local derby on Wednesday.”

Brora started brightly, playing the same expansive football and using the full width of the park and forced a succession of corners but without creating any clear chances. However, on 15 minutes Inverurie took the lead against the run of play and it was a goal of Brora’s own making. The home side were knocking the ball around in defence and a loose pass inside by James Ross resulted in keeper Joe Malin being caught in possession and the loose ball broke to Locos Neil MacLean who skilfully lobbed into the empty net from 30 yards. 

This unexpected lead put Inverurie tails up and Martin Laing’s right wing run and cross was scrambled away closely followed by a long shot by Joe MacCabe held at the far post.

Midway through the first half the Cattachs claimed for a penalty when there was a suspicion that Craig Campbell’s cross from the left corner of the box was blocked by a hand. The rest of the first half saw Brora dominating possession but struggling to create any goal threat and Inverurie sitting in and inviting the home side on to them. During this spell, Inverurie’s Greg Mitchell was booked for a foul and Connor Rennie joined him in the referee’s notebook on half time for a couple of nibbles at Zander Sutherland.

Brora brought on John Pickles for James Ross at the start of the second half and were now showing greater urgency than in the first period. They were now playing a very attacking 3-5- 2 to try and get back on terms and on 51 minutes added more width by bringing on flanker Andrew Greig for Dale Gillespie. Brora’s Craig Campbell was booked following a stramash on the halfway line in which Inverurie’s Andrew Hunter seemed fortunate not to see yellow and Brora replaced Steven MacKay with Paul Brindle.

It seemed that Brora’s commitment to all out attack had backfired on them on 68 minutes when an Inverurie left wing corner went all the way through to the far post where Inverurie full back Gordon Forsyth was unmarked to tap home Locos second goal. Inverurie then tried to consolidate and batten down the hatches by withdrawing front men Joe MacCabe and Neil MacLean and replacing them with Michael Selfridge and Jordan Leyden. 

It seemed that the breaks were going Inverurie’s way when Paul Brindle won a race with Locos keeper Scott Mathieson to chase down a short pass back but the ball flew narrowly wide in the 72nd minute.

However, 10 minutes from the end Brora had a chance to get back into it. Martin MacLean played yet another pass wide left to Andrew Greig whose cross-shot was blocked just inside the penalty box. The referee pointed to the spot in what seemed a harsh award. Martin MacLean stepped up to half the deficit.

Inverurie responded by replacing forward Martin Laing with Colin Charlesworth to try and hold onto their lead for the final 10minutes. However, their efforts were undone 5 minutes from time and there was no disputing this goal. After a left wing run, Andrew Greig squared inside to Martin MacLean on the edge of the box and he dispatched a beautiful dipping shot into the roof of the net.

The final minutes saw Brora throw everything but the kitchen sink into the Inverurie goalmouth in an effort to snatch a late winner but Inverurie held out and during this spell Gordon Forsyth became the visitors third booking of the afternoon.
