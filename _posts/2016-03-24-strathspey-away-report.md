Brora comfortably overcame an in-form Strathspey Thistle team 6-1 at Grantown on Spey on Wednesday evening. 

Strathspey fresh from a victory over Clachnacuddin and a draw with Deveronvale, started keenly and certainly matched Brora in the early opening exchanges. 

Brora had the first real chance of the match but Brindle's effort was well saved by the Jags keeper. However it did not take Brora too long to establish dominance and Zander Sutherland opened the scoring after assists from Greig and Brindle. 

It was Brindle who added a second, to give the Cattachs a comfortable cushion going into the half time break. 

Unlike recent weeks, where Brora have been vulnerable after the restart, this week was quite the opposite, and within 3 minutes of the restart Brindle had added two more and notched up his hat-trick. 

Macleod did manage to pull one back for the home side with a well taken finish, but Brora were very dominant by this stage and Munro and Mackay added further for the 6-1 victory. 

This was a welcome return to form for Brora, who played some really excellent football, and had it not been for some great saves from the Jags keeper, would have scored considerably more. 

This performance will have given the players a lift and a confidence booster ahead of what will be a titanic game against Formartine on Saturday.
