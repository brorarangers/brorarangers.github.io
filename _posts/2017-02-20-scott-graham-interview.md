Making a welcome return to Brora Rangers shortly after the appointment of Ross Tokely as manager is former striker Scott Graham.

Scott, who had been in the second title winning team at Brora under David Kirkwood, spent the start of this campaign at Forres Mechanics, has come home to Dudgeon Park as we aim to regain the Highland League Title. We caught up with Scott this week to get his thoughts on returning to The Cattachs and what he feels he can bring to one of the most eagerly anticipated title races in Highland League history.

“It’s great to be back at Brora Rangers, and it feels like I haven't really been away to be honest. The boys have been 1st class since I've been back and I'm really enjoying it.”

“There seems to be a really good buzz about the place right now. Training is very good; the boys are all working hard and it is coming together on Saturdays, which is the most important thing. There haven’t been huge differences to my 1st time at Brora, just subtle changes which in all honesty are making a lot of difference on and off the field.”

One of the most important things Scott has encountered in recent times is the joy of becoming a father. With this in mind, it gave him a great opportunity to weigh things up on the field as well as off the field.

“Obviously becoming a father puts a different perspective on things, I seem to be a lot more settled now in my personal life. This in turn, has had a really positive knock-on effect on the pitch. I'm really enjoying my football now, I am more controlled and focused and eager to do well not just for myself but for my family too. Anybody knows that having a child is a fantastic time in your life but, it is also massive as it's a huge commitment.”

This interview also gave us a chance to find out what Scott’s focus really is on returning to the Cattachs and why he wanted to make sure he got his switch back to Brora.

“First and foremost, Forres is a great club, run by great people. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there but in the end, it didn't work out. If I am being honest, I'm not getting any younger and I probably only have a few more years left to play at the level and fitness I am at the moment. I suppose, weighing everything up, being away for that short time made me realise I want to be as successful as possible in the time I have left in the Highland League.”

“I don't think I can give anymore as a player than I already give on the field, I think I work as hard as I can and try my very best every game. Looking back, the first season I joined Brora from Clach, I played every week. I was scoring goals and, we won the league championship going unbeaten for the whole season, quite incredible really. The second season I was in and out of the team and I was very unsettled. It's hard to get any sort of consistency in that situation where you don’t feel you can get in to a rhythm or flow. My attitude has definitely changed since I was last here without a doubt. I won't be distracted with anything this time and as I said, I am a lot more settled now than I was.  All I am doing now is just concentrating on enjoying my football”
