We are off to Starks Park to open our Irn Bru Cup campaign. It's a first visit to the Kirkcaldy club for Brora. San Starko, here we come! Mid week game? Jackie O's can wait.

Our Chairman was hoping for a home tie against one of the Colt teams, not surprisingly given our performance against Ross County last season.

Tokes, though, perhaps views it differently ...

"Well it is another away game in the Cup for the Club, but it is an interesting one which we look forward to. It gives the players a chance to pit themselves against League One opposition and, while we are very much the underdogs, we will go into the game without any fear.

Having just been relegated from the Championship in a play off game by Brechin City we face Raith Rovers under the new leadership of Barry Smith, who I know from his time as Ross County 20s coach.  They have recruited well in the summer and have some players I know well and played against myself.  It is a ground with a very good playing surface and I experienced winning there many times as a player.

The Club have not played at Starks Park so this is a first but having many players with league football experience and Scottish Cup experience we will be up for the challenge.  We will enjoy the game and with a bit of lady luck you just never know on the day.

It would be great to see as many fans down to support the team on the night like they do throughout the season."

There is no doubting we could have had a kinder draw, but then again, there is little doubting the hunger and confidence that Ross and the squad are bringinging into the new season. We are relishing this game, there is little doubt Barry Smith and his squad will view it any differently.


(Edit ... thank goodness this isn't a weekend game ... [the website editor has been away from Fife for too long](http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/news/end-of-an-era-as-kirkcaldy-nightclub-is-demolished-1-2624636))

Night Clubs apart, we are focusing on Ross' words ... **... and, while we are very much the underdogs, we will go into the game without any fear.**
