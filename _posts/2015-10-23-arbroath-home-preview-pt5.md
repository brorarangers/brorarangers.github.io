We've run out of time for the pre match warm ups. One sleep to go and then the big day is here.

Just to keep things tidy, we've had a quick look at: 

- [Arbroath's current form](/2015/10/19/arbroath-home-preview-pt1.html)

- [The part the supporters play](/2015/10/20/arbroath-home-preview-pt2.html)

- [Some Brora Rangers Scottish Cup history](/2015/10/21/arbroath-home-preview-pt3.html)

- [Last season's Cup campaign](/2015/10/22/arbroath-home-preview-pt4.html)

There are plenty of other Cup games to look back at, but now feels far more like a time for looking forward. Brora Rangers have a wealth of Scottish Cup experience, Richie Brittain, Stuart Kettlewell and Joe Malin have made it all the way to the final. Stuart Golabek and Grant Munro know exactly what it takes to knock the big teams out. The backbone of the squad that had Championship side Queen of the South [on the back foot](/2015/10/22/arbroath-home-preview-pt4.html) for a time last season will be present tomorrow and will have no fear of facing an SPFL Club.

Our last two matches against [Strathspey Thistle](/2015/10/11/strathspey-home-report.html) and [Forres Mechanics](/2015/10/18/forres-home-report.html) saw the lads really move up a gear ahead of Saturday's game. To quote the Manager after the 6-0 defeat of Forres, *“Everything we did, we did with intent and purpose, there was a great intensity to our play.”*

Training has been going well this week, Sandy will no doubt have the pitch in tip top condition (does he ever do anything less?). It may seem like there is little left to do. 

Fortunately, that is far from the truth. This week has just been one delicious long apéritif. Sure, the usual suspects will have been working behind the scenes at Dudgeon Park, and there will be a flurry of activity on Saturday morning to make sure everything is ship shape to welcome our SPFL guests. The management team and the players will complete their final preparations. Now it's time to move on to the main course.

There have been numerous studies carried out by the number crunchers and statisticians into the effect of *'The Twelfth Man'* across different sports. As usual with statistics they frequently disagree on their outcomes. [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2014/06/home-advantage-football) reported last June on some of these studies. Partisan crowds influencing referees, travelling time and broken routines having an adverse effect on the away team and a better knowledge of your own home turf have all been considered factors.

In our own hugely scientific study we present the following evidence.

Exhibit 1: **Cattach Vociferous.**

**Cattach Vociferous** is a strange beast. It's red and white plumage becomes especially vibrant as the weekend approaches, though can occasionally be seen on dark, wet Wednesday nights. Whilst it can be almost subdued within the KW9 6QH area, this is not alway the case, and never the case when outwith its home environment.

With the ability to increase in size and volume almost at will, it is a formidable creature and should never be underestimated. If seen, please don't panic - the National Press are aware ..

Exhibit 2: **Cattach Victorious**

**Cattach Victorious** has a winning mentality. Early studies suggest that Cattach Victorious relies heavily on the presence of Cattach Vociferous in the atmosphere, when it can be seen to burn with a bright red flame which is almost impossible to extinguish.

Exhibit 3: **Cattach Comejoinus**

**Cattach Comejoinus** has become an integral part of the Brora Rangers journey. Originally picked out as the poster boy for the supporters' [BRIT](/2015/09/06/improvement-trust-launch.html) initiative, Cattach Comejoinus has now become the symbol of the Supporters Club drive to welcome new fans to follow Brora Rangers. Cattach Comejoinus is typical of the **Cattach Vociferous** genus, he's a master chemist and understands the intracies of the reaction that can occur when Cattach Victorious and Cattach Vociferous are present in large quantities. He's a friendly bloke, and he really wants to see you on Saturday afternoon.

Before we finish our warm up to the William Hill Scottish Cup game between ourselves and Arbroath FC, all at Brora Rangers would like to wish the best of luck to our fellow Highland Football League clubs who are fighting to progress to Round 3.

Inverurie Loco Works vs Edinburgh University, Formartine Utd vs Clyde, Huntly vs East Stirlingshire and Clachnacuddin vs Linlithgow Rose are the other home ties against teams from outwith our League. Buckie Thistle travel to Edinburgh City while Forres Mechanics travel to East Kilbride. Nairn County and Wick Academy face each other in a dress rehearsal for next month's North of Scotland Cup, Turriff Utd meet Fraserburgh in a repeat of the Aberdeenshire Shield and Cove Rangers travel to Fort William in the all Highland League ties.

We also wish Arbroath FC and their travelling support a safe journey north tomorrow.

Finally, a quick update on the optomistic weather forecast from the start of the week.

Don't let that fool you, though. **Cattach Vociferous** always make the sun shine in the Red Shed. **See you on Saturday**
