Back at the start of June one of our supporters mooted the idea of starting a *fans' sponsorship fund*. Discussion on our Facebook Supporters Page was incredibly positive and over the summer, through the hard work of a small team of supporters, accounts were opened, official papers were drawn up and the **Brora Rangers Improvement Trust** was born.

The purpose of the Trust is to stimulate and help fund ground improvements at Dudgeon Park. The Trust is administered by a team from the Supporters Club, and all those who contribute to the Trust have an equal vote in how the money is spent.

You can read the [official documentation here](/downloads/BRIT%20core%20principles.pdf) and get in touch with the administration team on [fansbrit@btinternet.com](mailto:fansbrit@btinternet.com) or by filling in the contact form on our [Home page](/#brit).

This is a fantastic way to both show your support for Brora Rangers Football Club and have a say in future developments at Dudgeon Park.

The Board and Committee of Brora Rangers would like to thank David Freeman, Colin MacBeath, Stuart Clark and Donald Maclennan for the oraganisation and running of what promises to be a very important part of our plans for the future of Brora Rangers.
