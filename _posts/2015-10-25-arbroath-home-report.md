Brora's involvement in the William Hill Scottish Cup ended at the hands of Arbroath on Saturday, as the Angus side ran out 2-1 winners on a blustery autumnal day at Dudgeon Park.

A 500+ crowd had turned up, but in all honesty were treated to a game which in large was spoilt by a very strong wind.

The match was preceded with a minute's silence to respectfully mark the passing of a stalwart of the Brora Rangers Football Club's support.

Brora had the lion's share of possession in the first half but it was Arbroath who went in 1-0 at half time after Grehan converted a penalty following a careless tackle by Martin Maclean.

Again it was Brora who started the brighter and on 50 minutes, Martin Maclean made amends for his earlier faux pas when his 25 yard curling shot beat the outstretched Arbroath keeper.

Regrettably Brora could not consolidate their position, and were careless in allowing Linn to run at the defence, before passing to Ramsay who finished with aplomb.
