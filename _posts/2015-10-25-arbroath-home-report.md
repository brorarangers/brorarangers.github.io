There will be no fairytale Scottish Cup run for Brora Rangers this year as they were beaten by SPFL outfit Arbroath 2-1 at Dudgeon Park on Saturday. 

A crowd of northwards of 500 turned out including a large vocal support from the Angus team. Whilst noisy they nevertheless helped create a great atmosphere throughout the match. 

On a very windy autumnal day, the blustery conditions made playing football difficult for most of the match, but that nevertheless did not limited the intensity of the game. 

Speaking after the game Brora player manager Richard Brittain expressed his bitter disappointment at their cup exit, and felt that Brora were desperately unfortunate not to take anything from the tie. 

Brora started very brightly with the speedy Brindle and Greig causing the Arbroath back line great problems. 

Brora were forced into unplanned personnel changes when after 15 minutes the Cattachs leading scorer for the season, Paul Brindle limped off with a leg injury. This was a serious setback for Brora  but with Gavin Morrison coming on, it allowed Martin Maclean to push forward and link up with Greig and Sutherland. 

Brora looked to have taken the lead in the 20th minute but Scott Graham's effort was scooped off the the line with the Arbroath keeper well beaten. At the other end Arbroath tested Malin with several long range efforts and Linn went close with a curling shot. Brora continued to press the visitors and Maclean misfired on a couple of occasions. 

The deadlock was broken in the 29th minute when Grehan converted a penalty to put Arbroath ahead against the run of play. A training ground short corner exercise saw Grehan move swiftly to collect the ball which Martin Maclean was slow to pick up, and his clumsy challenge brought down the Smokies striker in the penalty box. Referee Craig Napier was only  five yards away and had no hesitation in awarding the spot kick. 

Arbroath went into the half time break one to the good, despite Brora having the lion's share of possession and the having created the best chances. 

Again it was Brora who restarted the brighter and Greig again had a shot go narrowly wide. However in the 50th minute Martin Maclean picked up the ball outside the box, created space and an angle and planted the ball into the top right hand corner of the goal from 25 yards with his looping strike. 

Arbroath were shaken by the equaliser and added a man to the middle of the field to stabilise the ship, but Brora very nearly added a second, but Sutherland could not get any purchase on his shot, which Flemming gathered comfortably. 

Brora were caught in the 58th minute when Ramsay scored beautifully from 25 yards past the outstretched arms of Malin.  

Arbroath picked up the ball deep in their own half and Johnstone was allowed the space to run at the Brora defence. Unchallenged he travelled 40 yards drawing both Williamson and Houston into him before delivering a short pass inside and Ramsay finished the job. 

Due to Wick Academy being involved in a Cup replay, the derby game against them next week at Brora has been postponed. Club board member William Powrie expressed disappointment that this much anticipated fixture will have to be moved, especially as the club had, had many bookings for their hospitality package and were looking forward to welcoming their guests. However some quick footwork from the league authorities have ensured Brora are not redundant as they travel to Inverurie Loco's for a vital championship game.
