Plans to keep an eye on the meeting between Stranraer and Raith Rovers were foiled by the weather at the weekend. The remnants of Storm Brian and any watching water polo scouts were the only winners.

Given [our performance against Raith Rovers](/2017/08/15/raith-away-report/) back in August we hoped to see how The Blues stood up against the Fifers.

[RaithTV](http://www.raithrovers.net/raithtv) captured highlights of the game perfectly. Especially impressive given the weather conditions.

Who would be a referee in these circumstances? Over 100 fans had travelled down from Fife along with the team (Pretty much the same distance as our trips to Harlaw Park). Both Clubs keen to get the fixture played. Groundsmen doing what groundsmen do best and making every effort to get the pitch fit for a game. A very, very waterlogged pitch which brings with it little chance of football and every chance of injury. Tough call.

However, what it means for us is little video footage to see exactly where our William Hill Scottish Cup opponents sit ahead of our 3rd Round meeting on the 18th November.

However, fear not, Cattachs. Tokes didn't spend all his years since leaving Huntly for the brand spanking new Inverness Caledonian Thistle and working his way up to the then SPL without making friends all around the Scottish football scene.

It's an all or nothing game for ourselves as a Club. Ross knows it. The squad know it.

But it is the Scottish Cup, it's a trip to new grounds, it's an adventure waiting to happen. We challenge anyone who travelled to Montrose for the first Pyramid Playoff season to deny it wasn't one of the best football days out you've ever had.

It isn't that long ago that we headed down to Stranraer's neighbours, Queen of the South. Did we win? Naw. Did the final score even look like we might have come close? Naw. Did a team from the Highland League give the home support a fright? You'd better believe it. Did we take more away fans to Palmerston than anyone else that season? OK, naw ... but not far from it. Games against the Leith end of Edinburgh and the Govan side of Glasgow did better than Brora ... the rest of the Championship that season? Must try harder. Actually, as 'best days out' that has to be up there with Dundee, and Montrose.

So, the long and the short of it ... Tokes is happy, Storm Brian is done, the draw / redraw is what it is, and the 4th Round is there for the taking. We need to be strong on the pitch, we need to be organised, we need to be smart ... but most of all, we need some noise like we had in these big games against Queen of the South and Montrose.

This time it might make all the difference.

The 4th Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup beckons, regardless of the weather forecast.
