Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the launch of their new look website, brorarangers.football designed to keep the viewer informed of all things which are going on at Dudgeon Park. 

Board member William Powrie said, " We do hope that our new website will meet the needs of both Brora supporters and visitors to the club. The site has been designed to allow quick functional access via mobile devices as well as desktops, and will continue to have content and useful information added to it. The format is very different to other sites but I'm very confident it will be well received" 

We especially want to keep everybody up to date with events and developments and we believe this website sets us up with a platform to do just that. 

We would like to put on record, on behalf of the Board, our thanks to Ranald Mackay who has both designed and developed the site, in a very short period of time. 

The website, together with our new look enhanced match day programme and the "next match" posters, is a further strand in promoting the club and standardising our image. 

Our old website will fall dormant from today so be sure to add our great new address brorarangers.football into your phone,tablet and PC.
